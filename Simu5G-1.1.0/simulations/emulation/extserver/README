In this example the network consists of two UEs connected to one eNB, one PGW, 
one router and one external (real) server.

For downlink traffic the external server sends 10MB to ue1 using TCP.
For uplink traffic, ue2 sends 10MB to the external server using TCP.

To run this example, you have to run the external server(s):

- For downlink traffic use e.g. "Iperf" with following command line:
  	iperf -c 10.0.0.1 -P 1 -i 1 -m -p 10021 -M 536.0B -l 10.0M -f m -t 0
- For uplink traffic use e.g. "Iperf" with the following command line:
  	iperf -s -P 1 -i 1 -p 10021

IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files (see "routing" folder).
 
 
=== HOW TO BUILD AND RUN ===

Compile the simulator from the command line by running (in the root Simu5G folder):
	$ make makefiles
	$ make 
	 	
Run the simulation by launching the script ./run.sh
