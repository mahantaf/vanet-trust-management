/**
 * @brief Represents one partition in a parallel simulation. Knows about
 * partitions and the links between this partition and its neighbours.
 *
 * Interconnections are stored not directly inside this object,
 * but in cProxyGate's of cPlaceholderModule's. The remote address fields
 * of cProxyGate's are filled out here in the connectRemoteGates() method.
 *
 * This layer also handles generic (synchronization-independent part of)
 * communication with other partitions:
 *
 * - cMessages outgoing from this partition flow through here
 *   (processOutgoingMessage()), and
 *
 * - incoming messages are processed at here by processReceivedBuffer()
 *   (invoked from the synchronization layer, cParsimSynchronizer)
 *
 * This layer is communication library independent (i.e it contains
 * no MPI, PVM, etc. calls) -- it builds on the abstraction layer provided
 * by cParsimCommunications.
 *
 * @ingroup Parsim
