2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2019-11-07  Attila Torok

	* Make info text of connections (the "t" display string tag) to be
	left/right/center aligned as well.

2019-11-21  Attila Torok

	* Don't use cObject* item data when the inspectors aren't fresh.
	This caused a crash when gathering tooltips in Fast mode, and the object
	pointer set on some figure was stale.

2019-12-03  Attila Torok

	* Implemented cLabelFigure::angle.

2019-11-11  Attila Torok

	* LogInspector: Fix assertion failure when the simulation is restarted with
	an empty Log buffer.

2019-05-29  Attila Torok

	* Allow dragging submodules around by holding Shift, changing their
	DisplayStrings.

2019-11-10  Andras Varga

	* Fix copy/paste bug in Find Object dialog's code.

2019-10-30  Attila Torok

	* Add some sideways offset to methodcall animation lines and text, to
	reduce overlap with connection arrows.

2019-10-25  Attila Torok

	* Connection items: Make the "m=[nesw]" display string tag work better
	with "border-to-border" connections.

2019-10-30  Attila Torok

	* Fix crashes on inspector close / network rebuild / quit.

2019-11-05  Andras Varga

	* Object inspector: Display null pointers as "nullptr" instead of "NULL"

2019-10-24  Attila Torok

	* Minor layout tweak in PreferencesDialog.

2019-10-21  Attila Torok

	* Add option to export module graphics to an image, and a dialog to
	select the exported area.

2019-10-22  Attila Torok

	* TextViewerWidget: Give one less chance for too deep recursion in
	updateScrollbars().

2019-10-22  Attila Torok

	* Message animator: Fix a crash in complicated methodcall/messagesend
	combinations, discovered in the INET queueing tutorial.

2019-10-17  Gyorgy Szaszko

	* Fix assertion failure in TextViewerWidget when inspected object is
	deleted.

2019-09-20  Attila Torok

	* Fix DisplayUpdateController::skipToNextEvent(). It did not really skip
	if there was a non-holding animation in progress.

2019-09-20  Attila Torok

	* Start the simulation at t=0, not right before the first event.

2019-09-10  Attila Torok

	* Fix assertion failure in LogInspector when restarting the	simulation.

2019-09-09  Attila Torok

	* Do not allow endSend() right after beginSend(), no sendDirect() or
	sendHop() calls in between. This caused a crash, so we now explicitly
	disallow and avoid it.

2019-09-16  Attila Torok

	* Fix a crash when closing inspector windows with Qt >=5.12.

	Before, the inspector was deleted by us manually, right inside the
	closeEvent() callback. With older Qt versions, this caused no problems,
	because no widget member was accessed after the event. Not so long ago
	this changed, so we now have to rely on Qt for deleting the Inspector
	when it is closed, but it works well.

	See: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-78314

2019-09-20  Attila Torok

	* Align the lines of info text of submodule graphics items
	appropriately in the left/top/right positions.

2019-08-27  Andras Varga

	* Performance: cache min(animSpeed) in cCanvas, so that Qtenv doesn't
	have to compute it every time.

2019-08-26  Attila Torok

	* Prevent user from manually calling finish() twice after error.

2019-08-16  Andras Varga

	* Fix possible duplicate LF_END_RUN notification.

2019-08-26  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: When counting/collectiong cObject children,
	catch exceptions and show the error.

2019-08-27  Attila Torok

	* Put "Qtenv" into argv instead of "app" - it is visible in some
	window managers.

2019-08-26  Attila Torok

	* Set a busy indicator (spinny cursor) during more potentionally
	long operations.

2019-08-26  Attila Torok

	* When the layouting process takes a long time (more than five seconds),
	ask the user what to do (wait or finish).

2019-07-17  Attila Torok

	* Internal renames: performAnimations() -> performHoldAnimations(),
	endAnimations() -> skipHoldAnimations().

2019-07-16  Attila Torok

	* Keep caret (cursor) near the same event when switching
	LogInspector modes.

2019-07-16  Attila Torok

	* Remove the unused scrollbackLimit option. Update the Preferences
	dialog accordingly.

2019-08-07  Attila Torok

	* Add a "Debug Now" option to the Simulate menu.

2019-07-03  Andras Varga

	* Fix aborting when user enters invalid log prefix in Preferences.

2019-07-03  Andras Varga

	* Added "%<" (trim preceding whitespace) directive to the log prefix format.

2019-07-02  Andras Varga

	* Default log prefix format changed to use %K instead of %C. (%K only prints
	the context component if it is different from the event's module; %C always
	prints it.)

	%K results in shorter log, without losing information (event's module is
	already part of the event banner). In case the user wants to turn off
	event banners and/or produce grep-friendly log, s/he will likely want to
	adjust the log prefix format as well, to include more information.

2019-07-02  Andras Varga

	* Logging: omit adding the context component to the line, because it is
	typically also printed as part of the log prefix (%C or %K format tags).

2019-06-13  Attila Torok

	* Add an option to disable logging from refreshDisplay().

2019-06-13  Attila Torok

	* Color log output prefix according to LogLevel.

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2019-03-21  Attila Torok

	* Fix connection info string (dest gate name) in context menus.

2019-03-20  Andras Varga

	* Fix: search in lists brought up by the Inspect->Available Components command
	was not possible. The Find Objects dialog did not find the object to search in.

2019-03-20  Andras Varga

	* Prevent the Debug dialog from kicking in when inputting a wrong
	value in the Object Inspector.

2019-03-07  Attila Torok

	* Catch cRuntimeErrors coming from message printers in TextViewerProvider
	of LogInspector.

2019-01-28  Attila Torok

	* Fix a crash in MessageAnimator when a marked module is deleted.

2019-01-25  Andras Varga

	* HistogramInspector: tolerate inf as bin value
	* ChartTickDecimal: reject conversion from inf/nan; fix comparison with inf

2018-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Make sure video crop area is never invalid (out of bounds). By clipping
	it to the content area of the module inspector.

2018-10-04  Attila Torok

	* Rework video recording dialog, with added options.

	* Only resize the MainWindow to a multiple of 2, not 4, when
	recording video. Turns out, this is enough for yuv420p subsampling, and
	we don't plan to use any other.

2018-10-09  Attila Torok

	* Fix video recording getting stuck with holding built-in animations.
	* Do not animate messages from different sources concurrently.
	* Add getSourceModuleId() to Animations.

2018-10-04  Attila Torok

	* Store the settings in the .qtenvrc file when the preferences
	dialog is accepted.

	Not only on exit. This fixes the issue where an improper shutdown
	(crash on network teardown, etc) will not save the settings changes.

2018-11-05  Attila Torok

	* Fix crash when Qtenv is closed with an OutputVectorInspector open.

2018-10-04  Attila Torok

	* Always update the next event marker on inspector refresh.

	This fixes the "red rectangle lagging behind" problem with moving
	submodules, when stopping after express mode, or when running in normal
	mode at higher speeds.

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-21  Attila Torok

	* Close any "Find Objects" dialogs when the Main Window is closed.

	This avoids a crash that happened because the deleted network components
	caused the selection in the still open dialog to change, which tried to
	propagate the change to the built-in object inspector, but that was
	already deleted. I think.

2018-06-19  Attila Torok

	* Fix: The cTerminationException message dialog was not displayed.

2018-06-12  Attila Torok

	* Do not store inspector windows for objects with empty full path.
	This caused an enormous number of inspector windows to be opened after an
	inspector for an inet::RouteEntry (IIRC) - which has no name or owner, so
	its fullPath is "" - was open previously, was stored. Because of this,
	the next time Qtenv was started, the 'stored inspector' matched every
	single inet::RouteEntry instance created anywhere, so an inspector for
	all of them was opened. It took a long time to close them all.

2018-06-15  Attila Torok

	* Fix crash when animating method call at shutdown

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-06-08  Attila Torok

	* Improved debug-on-error, debugger detection and attachment

	- New menu item: Simulate -> [] Debug on Errors

	- When an error occurs, it offers to launch a debugger.

	- See envir/ChangeLog for related improvements

2018-06-04  Attila Torok

	* Workaround for crash in GOI with Qt 5.11. Seems like changing the
	source model regressed with this Qt version.

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2018-03-14  Attila Torok

	* Fix circular_buffer::grow(). One memcpy is not enough.
	This caused shuffled log output when the simulation was run for a while,
	then the network was rebuilt, then run again for a bit longer.

2018-03-06  Attila Torok

	* Entirely new animation algorithm in DisplayUpdateController.

	* Animation Parameters dialog: If there is no animation speed,
	  display "not set" instead of 0.

	* Animation Parameters dialog: Display current simulation speed.
	  It is colored red if the simulation cannot keep up with the
	  requested animation speed (simulationSpeed < animationSpeed *
	  playbackSpeed, by some margin)

2018-03-01  Attila Torok

	* Log Viewer: added support for ANSI control sequences: bold/italic/
	underline on/off, foreground/background color (16-color palette,
	256-color palette, RGB), reset foreground/background color, reset all.

2018-03-01  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: Use the new cMessagePrinter Options API,
	add config dialog.

2018-03-12  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: Disable packet mode if the inspected object
	is not cPacket.

2018-01-10  Levente Mészáros

	* Generic Object Inspector: Don't call getDynamicTypeString for fields with
	nullptr value. This fixes the std::bad_typeid exceptions when clicking
	on previous messages in the LogInspector in some INET simulations.

2018-02-15  Attila Torok

	* OSG: Add missing include to fix build with newer osgEarth versions.

2018-02-13  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: Catch cRuntimeErrors thrown by getFieldValueAsString()

2018-03-01  Attila Torok

	* HistogramInspector: More fixes (tick drawing with large values)

2018-01-26  Attila Torok

	* HistogramInspector: Visualize outlier bins (drawn with a different
	color than normal bins), and show info about them.

2018-01-24  Attila Torok

	* HistogramInspector: Fixes (weighted mode, rendering of subpixel-wide cells)

2018-01-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow histogram API changes.

2018-01-04  Andras Varga

	* Follow cPar INT-related changes

2018-01-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Adjusted inspector and log window colors for better visibility on dark themes.

2017-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Follow cEnvir change: Implemented getZoomLevel().

2017-12-13  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: Group the mode switching actions into an ActionGroup.
	This way, when the button of the already active mode is clicked (again),
	it won't pop out (become "unchecked"), causing confusion.

2017-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: "Packet" mode added. It is similar to the
	"Flat", but only displays fields that have the @packetData property on them.

2017-01-16  Andras Varga

	* Replace gettimeofday() occurrences with opp_get_monotonic_clock_usecs(),
	and struct timeval with plain int64_t.

2017-11-28  Andras Varga

	* osg/osg.msg: Updated to recent message compile changes (property names
	camelized, etc).

2017-11-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow NED->Ned naming change in class/function names

2017-12-12  Andras Varga

	* Follow cPar longValue()->intValue() method rename and other changes.

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-11-27  Attila Torok

	* Module Log view: fix occasional ASSERT failure. Fix was to add missing
	index reconstruction to getTabStops() in ModuleOutputProvider.

2017-10-01  Attila Torok

	* Activate the MainWindow and toplevel Inspectors when needed.
	Activation means that the given window now "has focus". The MainWindow as
	re-activated after the saved inspectors are restored after network setup.
	The top level inspectors are activated when they need to be given
	attention - when their object is "inspected" again.

2017-10-06  Attila Torok

	* Enable horizontal scrolling in the Object Tree (the top left one)

2017-11-27  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: fix crash on closing an inspector

2017-10-06  Attila Torok

	* Generic Object Inspector: Stretch the highlight rectangle to viewport width.

2017-09-29  Andras Varga

	* Fix exit behavior after simulation error.
	Do not ask for confirmation or offer calling finish. This is consistent
	with both Tkenv behavior and the label of the Preferences checkbox
	("Ask for confirmation when simulation is in progress" -- a failed
	simulation does not count as "in progress")

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-09-15  Attila Torok

	* The AnimationControllerDialog is not hidden on network rebuild,
	just updated.

	* Fix: Submodule shape size is affected by zoom level again.

2017-09-13  Attila Torok

	* Quit confirmation: Do not ask when there is no simulation in progress.

2017-08-24  Attila Torok

	* Handle SIGINT and SIGTERM better.

2017-06-28  Attila Torok

	* MainWindow: Display stats in BUSY state as well.

	Needed for example for the sockets sample, when the cRTSocketScheduler is
	calling cEnvir::idle() in which Qtenv updates the display, and we don't
	want to see just three "n/a"-s.

2017-07-27  Attila Torok

	* LogInspector: Actually apply the module exclusion filter after it
	is restored.

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: use C++11's range-based for loops where applicable, using
	clang-tidy's modernize-loop-convert.

	* Modernizing: replace INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT and LL with C++11's PRId64.
	Note: PRId64 includes the "d" that was not part of INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
	alias LL.

2017-07-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed a typo in Makefiles that prevented building on Windows.

2017-07-03  Attila Torok

	* GenericObjectInspector: Fall back to the descriptor of the statically
	declared type of object fields when a descriptor for their dynamic type
	cannot be found.

2017-05-25  Attila Torok

	* Fixed a few issues reported by the Clang static analyzer.

2017-06-14  Attila Torok

	* Fix tab order (focus traversal) of widgets in	AnimationControllerDialog.

	* Make the RunSelectionDialog big enough initially so all Configuration
	names/descriptions fit in the ComboBox.

2017-06-08  Attila Torok

	* OSG Viewer is in a separate library, loaded at runtime.

	Motivation:

	OSG and especially osgEarth added a huge number of dependencies to Qtenv,
	and to all simulation executables independent of whether or not 3D was
	actually used by the simulation. This increased load time and made
	debugging harder.

	Change:

	Qtenv and the sim library does not depend at all on OSG or osgEarth. OSG
	support is in a separate library loaded at runtime. If the model uses
	OSG, then it needs to link with the necessary libraries.

	Sim API change:

	One must use cOsgCanvas::EarthViewpoint instead of osgEarth::Viewpoint in
	models.

	Details:

	The library is called oppqtenv-osg. It is looked for in the same places
	as the other libraries specified by the -l command line argument of
	opp_run. It is loaded with dlopen/LoadLibrary, so the rules of their
	operation apply.

	If the library could not be loaded, dummy viewers will be created in
	place of the real ones. The dummy viewers just print a short message
	about the failed loading of the library. The class descriptor for
	cOsgCanvas, its inner classes, and for osg::Node and osg::Group are
	also loaded from this support library.

	No WITH_OSG or WITH_OSGEARTH conditionals anywhere in omnetpp or qtenv.
	The only difference with WITH_OSG is whether or not the support library
	gets built. Inside that, there are WITH_OSGEARTH conditionals still.

	Additionally, OSG frame rate was decreased from 60 to 30 fps.

2017-05-25  Attila Torok

	* GenericObjectInspector: Fixed some crashes when inspecting dynamically
	changing object hierarchies. Editing a value in the inspector while the
	simulation runs is now easier, and pauses the simulation momentarily.

	Technical details:

	Until now, the QAbstractItemModel implementation (GenericObjectTreeModel)
	was basically a single-use throw-away object: it was recreated each time
	the inspector was refreshed. This was not optimal for many reasons (one
	is performance, an other one is usability - since the selection was not
	preserved between refreshes, editing was nearly impossible in Run mode,
	and a few others). It was also just a thin "proxy" layer between the Qt
	layouting/painting/etc. mechanisms and the simulation model objects (plus
	some caching...), which affected stability in some cases, especially in
	Express mode. From now on, the model is only deleted and recreated when
	the inspected object, or the inspector "mode" changes. On any regular
	refresh other than these, the item model detects changes both in node
	data and tree structure, and notifies Qt about the changes accordingly.
	It now also stores all presented data internally, taking care to only
	access the simulation model when it is considered "safe", and not at all
	during Qt event processing. This should improve stability substantially.

2017-06-02  Attila Torok

	* ModuleInspector: When a figure is clicked, it is now put in the history
	of the embedded object inspector before its associated object.

2017-05-30  Attila Torok

	* Miscellaneous cleanups, performance improvements and fixes.

2017-05-31  Attila Torok

	* Fixed an issue where modules and figures were not consistent with the
	simulation time display right after the network was built and
	initialize() was called, or when the "Run until..." target was reached.

2017-05-25  Attila Torok

	* ModuleInspector: Refined network graphics updates based on change
	callbacks. It is more incremental now, should be faster.

	* Some tweaks to the implementation of basic Inspector functionality.

2017-05-31  Attila Torok

	* Higher factory default for minimum value in the spinboxes in the
	'Animation parameters' dialog.

	* Canvas layers (tag filter) dialog geometry is now persistent.

	* Show (debug) or (release) in the window title based on NDEBUG.

2017-05-19  Attila Torok

	* Fixed a few random memory leaks (especially in the network layouter).

2017-05-25  Attila Torok

	* Figures with NaNs in their bounds should no longer break canvas rendering.

2017-05-17  Attila Torok

	* Fixed Bezier segment rendering (especially smooth continuations) in path figures.

	* A bit more spacing around text in module items and on the timeline.

2017-05-11  Attila Torok

	* Inspector crash fixes, internal simplifications.

2017-05-10  Attila Torok

	* The size of arrowheads on connections and line figures is now more
	reasonable with many combinations of zoom level, line width, and the
	"zoomLineWidth" property.

2017-05-10  Attila Torok

	* Completely overhauled figure rendering. This should improve performance
	and fix many issues.

	* The effective zIndex of figures is now global in a canvas, so it can
	cross figure tree branches. It is also relative (additive) to the
	effective zIndex of the parent figure. See the documentation of cFigure.

	* Implemented panel figure rendering correctly.

2017-04-18  Attila Torok

	* Figures without a tooltip inherit it from their nearest ancestor
	that has one. Empty strings break this inheritance, but are not shown.
	The own tooltip of the figure now overrides that of its associated object.

2017-04-07  Attila Torok

	* Fixed some graphics glitches when rendering outlined text (in network
	graphics and figures with halo).

2017-05-02  Attila Torok

	* Fixes for the generic Object Inspector:
	- Use the right font in the tree, and align the text better vertically.
	- The tree can now be scrolled horizontally too when needed.
	- Fixed an inconsistency in the model that caused broken branch
	  lines in the view.

2017-05-02  Attila Torok

	* The list of excluded components in the Log Output is now persistent.

	* The default name and location of the file when saving the log output
	was made more reasonable.

2017-05-12  Attila Torok

	* Saving run mode profiles (animation settings for the different run
	modes) to the local .qtenvrc file, as opposed to the global one.

2017-04-06  Attila Torok

	* Changed the contents and layout, and improved the usability of the
	'Animation Parameters' dialog. The spinboxes in it are now adjustable
	with steps proportional to the current value.

	* When recording a video, the first frame (which is visible exactly
	when the recording is started) is no longer omitted from the resulting
	image sequence.

2017-05-05  Attila Torok

	* The special value "kind" is now also accepted as a color in the "i" tag
	of display strings of messages as well.

2017-04-19  Attila Torok

	* Fix image colorization (tinting) of pixmap figures. Possible performance
	improvement of tinted images by increasing the cache size.

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2017-03-27  Attila Torok

	* macOS fixes: global menu did not appear; floating inspector windows
	could go behind the main window.

2017-03-14  Attila Torok

	* Fix: Always recompute module path in SendDirectAnimation because
	the modules referenced in it might have been deleted. Fixes a
	crash in the dyna sample, when a process in the server ends, while a
	graphical inspector is open for the server.

2017-03-14  Attila Torok

	* Remove deleted objects from the FindObjectDialog.

2017-03-13  Attila Torok

	* TextViewerWidget: Allow 0 height viewport.

	This happens mostly when a new inspector is opened, and output is
	appended to the backing buffer at the same time. Without this shortcut,
	the ASSERT a few lines below could fail.

2017-03-13  Attila Torok

	* Disable BSP cache for ModuleCanvasViewer.

	This avoids a crash inside Qt when traversing the tree. The proper
	solution would be to pedantically call prepareGeometryChange() in every
	custom item when needed. However, this might also improve performance.

2017-03-13  Attila Torok

	* Terminate the simulation right away when we run out of events.

	Instead of just stopping and terminating later, when the user tries to
	continue simulating. This relies on guessNextEvent too much. It really
	shouldn't.

2017-03-14  Attila Torok

	* Implement and enable HistogramInspector and OutVectorInspector
	[author Mihaly Palenik; refinements by Attila Török].

	* Make graphical inspectors pop up when double clicking in the
	general object inspector. This will make the Histogram and OutVector
	inspectors easily discoverable.

2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2017-02-02  Attila Torok

	* Replace ColorizeEffect with cached pixmap tinting.
	The effect made child figures of image figures colorized
	and pixelated, this was undesirable.
	Also, this should be faster in most cases.

2017-02-02  Attila Torok

	* MessageItem: Different arrowhead (small triangle), explicit line mode, fixed width.

2017-02-02  Attila Torok

	* Fix mouse selection of SelfTransformingPixmapItem.
	And a tiny simplification in usage.

2017-02-02  Attila Torok

	* Disable HistogramInspector and OutputVectorInspector skeletons.
	Temporarily, until they are completed, and work well enough.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Only show next event number if simulation is not running.
	When running, always show the number of the last event to avoid
	oscillation between the two in some situations.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Fixed image figure anchoring/resizing/transformation.
	When anchored and/or resized (with width/height) it
	messed up the coordinate system for child figures.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Added SelfTransformingPixmapFigure.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* parseColor() implementation moved to the right place.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Only process Qt events once in a while in Express mode.
	Should improve Ev/Sec performance, while keeping the Stop dialog responsive.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* ArrowheadItem painting glitches fixed.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* ModuleInspector: Arrowhead and module name preferences made more consistent and cleaner.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Added isTwoWayConnection utility function.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* msgitem: Don't switch to "non-line" mode if too short.
	Clamp length to at least width instead.

2017-01-31  Attila Torok

	* Avoid assertion failure with degenerate connection lines.

2017-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Fixed logging when "Print event banners" is disabled.

2017-01-20  Attila Torok

	* Object Inspector: Field editor positioning improved

2017-01-19  Attila Torok

	* Fix double-click zoom

2017-01-18  Attila Torok

	* Fix passing events from Qt to OSG; this fixes some camera manipulator
	mouse problems.

2017-01-16  Attila Torok

	* Apply figure tag filters instantly. Also, make the dialog a child of
	the Inspector. This way it won't appear	on the taskbar and similar gadgets.

2017-01-27  Attila Torok

	* Fixed/streamlined applying and storing log level.

2017-01-16  Attila Torok

	* Indent the "Short event banners" checkbox in the Preferencesdialog.

2017-01-16  Attila Torok

	* Added build-time Qt version check to qtenvdefs.h.

2017-01-18  Attila Torok

	* Module Inspector: Reduce painting glitches by calling update() in a
	few more places. This should fix the glitches when switching
	connection arrowhead drawing on/off, or between OSG and 2D mode.

2017-01-13  Attila Torok

	* Object tree text and tooltip formatting made prettier.

2017-01-26  Attila Torok

	* Log viewer: Update scrollbars on header resize, zero out offset if
	they are hidden.

2017-01-23  Attila Torok

	* Log viewer: Fixed copying single line selection, added copying to
	primary buffer.

2017-01-13  Attila Torok

	* Always store object IDs as 'long'

2017-01-09  Attila Torok

	* A few pointer checks added to OsgViewer.

2017-01-10  Attila Torok

	* Fixed OsgViewers getting stuck when the simulation is restarted.
	The key is the removeView call. Calling viewer->realise no longer seems
	necessary.

2017-01-05  Attila Torok

	* Do not immediately redraw the module when its layout changed, only
	set a flag.

2017-01-05  Attila Torok

	* Clear animations also when switching from normal Run to Fast mode.

2017-01-05  Attila Torok

	* Submodule positions are now updated if their DisplayString changes.
	And we only run the layouter if there are any submodules without a
	position.

2017-01-04  Attila Torok

	* TextViewerWidget header/toolbar layout changed.
	The toolbar is no longer laid out as a child of the viewport, but the
	header and the toolbar are both children of the viewer widget itself, in
	a grid layout. This reduces flickering in some corner cases.

2016-11-22  Attila Torok

	* TextViewerWidget can be scrolled vertically with pixel
	granularity. Also, there should be no more infinite scrollbar
	configuration show/hide	loops.

2017-01-06  Attila Torok

	* Perform holding animations at the end too when animating until the
	next event.

	This should fix the ASSERT failure in chopHoldingTail (from >
	currentPart). Also do not move the next event marker until they are done.
	For example in the routing example, the final part of the animation
	between to nodes (inside the receiving node) is a holding one, but
	follows a nonholding anim. To truly arrive right before delivery, we have
	to do that too, right after the first two parts.

2017-01-06  Attila Torok

	* Clear message delivery animations when the simulation is stopped.
	It looked really weird when the event was already done, and the next
	event marker moved on, but after starting again, the delivery was still
	animated.

2017-01-05  Attila Torok

	* Fix crash when drawing unconnected gates with "Arrange connections
	on vector gates parallel..." enabled.

2017-01-03  Attila Torok

	* Remove workaround for Qt4 on Mac from ModuleInspector.
	The floating toolbar could not paint over the OpenGL widget
	(OsgViewer), but with Qt5 this is no longer an issue.

2017-01-11  Attila Torok

	* Don't strip namespaces for internal uses like storing inspector
	windows and preferences, and appending to the message filter.
	This should fix the bug when the "exclude messages like
	this from animation" appended to the filter with the class name stripped
	according to the user setting in the preferences dialog, but the filter
	engine did not accept it that way. Also a small, now redundant idMatches
	function was removed.

2017-01-11  Attila Torok

	* Added namespace stripping mode parameter to getShortObjectTypeName().

2017-01-11  Attila Torok

	* MessageFilter: Fixed message name sanitization.

2017-01-12  Attila Torok

	* Added icon resource file aliases to make their references shorter.

2017-01-12  Attila Torok

	* Call refreshDisplay() after editing in the object inspector.

	Also some slightly related random formatting...

2017-01-12  Attila Torok

	* The "View | Show Status Details" menu item is now checkable.

2017-01-12  Attila Torok

	* Don't put duplicate objects into the context menu of the timeline.

2017-01-11  Attila Torok

	* Made the "STOP" dialog in Express mode more responsive.

	Before even input events were only handled with the frequency of
	inspector updates. This still does not make it significantly slower.

2017-01-06  Attila Torok

	* Added 'Canvases, figures' category to 'Find objects' dialog

2017-01-03  Attila Torok

	* Changed the end year in copyright headers to 2017.

2016-12-21  Attila Torok

	* Renamed a few classes related to object search.

	Namely:	InspectorListBox -> ObjectListModel; InspectorListBoxView ->
	ObjectListView (they had nothing to do with inspectors);
	FilteredObjectListDialog -> FindObjectsDialog

	And some data members and local variables too.

2016-12-22  Attila Torok

	* Fix: Single / double click events were swapped when passing them to OSG.

2016-12-22  Attila Torok

	* Pass event timestamps from Qt to OSG in OsgViewer.

	This should resolve the issue where "flicking" the camera using the
	"Earth" manipulator made it spin with an insane speed.

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-12-19  Attila Torok

	* ImageFigureRenderer: Don't use offset for positioning.

	Somehow internally it works with integers only, so for low resolution
	pixmaps scaled up, the position was rounded to the size of a pixel, which
	can be very coarse.

	Also removed version check for Qt 5.2.0.

2016-12-19  Attila Torok

	* The 'Run until...' button is now popped out if the dialog is cancelled.

2016-12-19  Attila Torok

	* MessageAnimator: Message animation update fixed.

	Don't begin any holding anims before deliveries, just update the playing
	ones, and advance reft after them.

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Fix OutlinedTextItem painting glitches.

	By informing Qt about changing boundingRect(). Previously changing the
	text of text figures did not properly repaint.

2016-12-16  Attila Torok

	* Make PreferencesDialog a child of MainWindow.

	This will stop it from appearing as a separate window on task bars /
	window list applets / app switcher panels / etc. In most cases. I hope.

2016-12-16  Attila Torok

	* Added the "Rebuild network" action to the main toolbar.

	Made a new icon for it, and changed the tooltip.

2016-12-16  Attila Torok

	* Remove the "logo128w" icon, and all references to it.

	That's the one with the little window on top of the logo in the corner.

2016-12-16  Attila Torok

	* MessageAnimator: Use map instead of unordered_map.

	The compiler on our mac builder is too old for it...

2016-12-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated logo immages and toolbar icons.

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* "Next event markers" fixed. Sometimes they were missing.

	Like when the user just got out of fast/express mode.

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* MessageAnimator::update() renamed to updateAnimations()

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Animate until before the next event when running until
	message/module.

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Fixes for simulations with no events (and for when we reach termination)

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* SimTime starts from right before the first event, not 0. Press F4
	N times -> execute N events.

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Added DUC::rightbeforeevent

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Make SendOnConn message anims visible right after (in the instance
	of) sending.

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* msgAnim shorthand added to duc

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Update MessageAnimator after stepping.

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Show the next Event# on the toolbar if we just stepped and
	animated until right before it.

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Stop simulation when the main window is closed... D'oh!

	In hopefully the right order.

2016-12-13  Attila Torok

	* More refreshDisplay and refreshInspectors calls,
	callRefreshDisplaySafe() added.

	Also changed assert in finishSimulation() to allow for running and busy
	states.

2016-12-12  Attila Torok

	* FindObjectsDialog: Persistent sorting, pref handling cleanup, some
	UI tweaks.

	Refresh button moved closer to the list. The label next to it says
	'Please push Refresh to execute search' initially.

2016-12-12  Attila Torok

	* DUC: Set SimTime to that of the next event after animating to it.

	Even with no animationSpeed.

2016-12-12  Attila Torok

	* Make messages sent in initialize() appear as waiting to be
	delivered.

	* Adjust animating flag. ModuleInsp: Remove unnecessary message
	redrawing. Also remove a comment about the now-obsolete "bgl" tag.

2016-12-12  Attila Torok

	* One-stepping now stops right before events, not after them.

2016-12-13  Attila Torok

	* Rethought exiting behaviour, like calling finish() and showing
	confirmation dialogs.

2016-12-12  Attila Torok

	* MainWindow: Focus is on 'Yes' when finishing simulation, some
	cleanups.

2016-12-12  Attila Torok

	* PreferencesDialog tweaks.

	Some checkboxes indented in the Animation tab, a few form layouts
	converted into grid layouts.

2016-12-13  Attila Torok

	* OsgViewer: Avoid double rendering while recording video, disable
	MSAA with Qt <5.6.0.

2016-12-06  Attila Torok

	* Removed support of Qt versions before 5.4 from OsgViewer.

2016-12-06  Attila Torok

	* Removed QT5 check in qtenvdefs.h.

	As it is now required.

2016-12-06  Attila Torok

	* Added QTENV_API to (almost) every class, and a few functions.

	Except for InspectorFactories, internal classes not defined in headers,
	and a few small utilities.

2016-12-14  Attila Torok

	* Don't show arrows for sendDirect anims if disabled, not just
	initially.

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Clear layout of deleted modules.

	This will fix this glitch: After selecting "Rebuild network", some
	modules had the positions of some random modules in the old instance of
	the network, others had random positions.

2016-12-13  Attila Torok

	* SubmoduleItem stacking order fixes.

	Always keep icon above shape, and decoration icon above both, regardless
	of the order in which they were set up.

2016-12-13  Attila Torok

	* Submodule bounds calculation with zoom level and icon scale.

	See the novel in the comments of Qtenv::getSubmoduleBounds()

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Moved next event markers from ModuleCanvasViewer to
	MessageAnimator.

2016-12-15  Attila Torok

	* Added proper (internal) getSubmodRect.

	Module size calculation takes 'is' tag into account even without an 'i'
	tag. Considering zoom factor and icon scale of a selected "primary"
	inspector Introduced SubmoduleItem::DEFAULT_ICON, etc. Also finished a
	sentence in a small comment.

2016-12-13  Rudolf Hornig

	* The RunSelectionDialog does not change the application icon now.

2016-12-06  Attila Torok

	* Respect the "Show sendDirect arrows" option.

2016-12-05  Attila Torok

	* Formatting/cleanup/comment smallies.

2016-12-02  Attila Torok

	* One-Stepping (F4) behaviour change, assertion failure fixes.

	Step mode-specific code path removed.

	The rough goal was this, when pressing the F4 key (or Step button on the
	toolbar...):

	 - If still running (run or step mode): Skip to and perform next event,
	animating it, then stop.
	- If stopped but not completed (during after-event holding anim, or
	between events): continue and stop before next event. (I think this one
	works differently, but might be better...)
	 If not running at all (stopped right before or after an event): Just
	perform the next event (after simtime arrived to it with smooth
	animation) and animate that one too, then stop.

	This change also required some adjustments to the workings of
	DisplayUpdateController.

2016-12-02  Attila Torok

	* Some useless/duplicate functions removed from MainWindow and
	Qtenv.

2016-11-29  Attila Torok

	* Printing code moved to ModuleCanvasViewer, QPrinter resolution bug
	workaround.

2016-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Run filters are now accepted, all logic done in the dialog.

	initialSetUpConfiguration() moved to Qtenv from MainWindow. Qtenv option
	and RunSelectionDialog parameter is now a run filter instead of a run
	number. default-configname preference key renamed to last-configname, and
	default-runnumber to last-runnumber. Various hacks to make the
	RunSelectionDialog (more likely to) appear centered over the MainWindow
	at startup.

	another runseldial

2016-12-02  Attila Torok

	* FilteredObjectListDialog: Remember sorting state after refresh,
	cleanups.

2016-12-01  Attila Torok

	* Notice of Uselessness added to qtenv.pro, plus some clarification.

2016-12-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: made the main targets depend on Makefile.inc so any change in it
	will trigger a rebuild.

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: Makefile refactored. Added clang-c2 support and optimized
	the build process.

	* build: removed Makefile.vc, as Visual C++ builds are now handled
	by the standard Makefiles.

2016-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Stop initial network layouting when MainWindow is closed.

	If the main window was closed while the first layoutign of the network
	was still running, the environment didn't quit, but the saved open
	Inspectors popped up without a main window after it finished.

2016-11-29  Attila Torok

	* Refactoring

2016-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Global module layouting, persistent seeds, modulesize calculation
	fixes, misc tweaks.

2016-11-30  Attila Torok

	* Refactoring

2016-11-29  Attila Torok

	* Image loading improved, related cEnvir API implemented.

2016-11-29  Attila Torok

	* Connections on vector gates can be arranged.

2016-11-28  Attila Torok

	* Fixed stripNamespace(), the method behind the "Hide namespace prefix"
	preference. The old version failed at stripping template types, such as
	std::vector<inet::RoutingTable *>.

2016-11-18  Attila Torok

	* .gitignore files created by the new (common, qmake-less) build
	system in clangc2 branch.

2016-11-21  Andras Varga

	* Tooltips: 1. eliminate continuous redraw (and thus, flashing) of
	tooltips over animated areas of the canvas 2. drop trailing "," for empty
	info strings

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change: implemented appendToImagePath(), loadImage(),
	getSubmodulePosition()

2016-11-16  Attila Torok

	* Add message animation crash guards.

2016-11-16  Attila Torok

	* MessageAnimation comments, renaming, formatting.

2016-11-16  Attila Torok

	* DisplayUpdateController::isExplicitAnimationSpeed removed, more
	fixes...

2016-11-16  Attila Torok

	* Animate the bodies of silent methodcalls.

2016-11-16  Attila Torok

	* Broadcast animation #0.

2016-11-15  Attila Torok

	* Respect cModule::getBuiltinAnimations().

2016-11-11  Attila Torok

	* DisplayUpdateController fixes.

	Switching into Express mode, recording in Fast mode, etc...

2016-11-11  Attila Torok

	* Not drawing static messages if message animation is disabled.

2016-11-09  Attila Torok

	* playbackSpeed: SpinBox in AnimCtrlDialog, Slider snaps to 1,
	affects recording.

2016-11-07  Attila Torok

	* RunModeProfiles in DisplayUpdateController made persistent.

2016-11-04  Attila Torok

	* Some comments and cleanups in MessageAnimator and
	DisplayUpdateController.

2016-11-14  Attila Torok

	* AnimationSpeed computation cleaned up. holdExpired added. Hold
	time: remaining -> end.

2016-11-14  Attila Torok

	* Properly clear and reset everything (for example when a new
	network is set up).

2016-11-15  Attila Torok

	* Message animation rework.

	Born from these (and many more) WIP commits:

	Do inter-event animation after the message anims are updated.
	Only a single currentMessageSend in MessageAnimator, more comments.
	Broadcast animation, senddirect tweaked, updateInInspector plugged.
	Disable arrowhead when the start of the message line is not visible.
	DeliveryAnimation added, SendAnimMode removed. Small fixes to message
	animation. WIP animation using the LogBuffer privateDup()'d messages.
	methodCall and messageSend animations merged, deliveries deduplicated.
	Animation::advance(). MethodcallAnimation cleanup. SendOnConn fixes,
	Delivery cleanups. MessageAnimation introduced DeliveryAnimation tweaks.
	End animations in update() if they become empty. * Don't use the
	privatedup as key in MessageAnimator. Less flicker before message
	delivery, animationspeed computed differently for message animations.
	SendDirect behavior changed, much simplified code, more stuff moved
	to MessageAnimation.

2016-11-04  Attila Torok

	* LogBuffer: Keep a map of privateDup'd messages, also duplicate on
	delivery.

2016-10-24  Attila Torok

	* OrderedMultiMap container added.

2016-11-09  Attila Torok

	* RunModeProfiles, other fixes.

2016-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Animation: Ability to display the message as a line added.

2016-11-09  Attila Torok

	* Removed a few preference options. Default for confirm-exit is on.
	Some text moved into tooltips.

	Removed: Minimum icon size, reusing inspectors, keep inspectors on top,
	update frequency in fast mode, resize inspector windows.

2016-11-09  Attila Torok

	* TreeItemModel performance improvement.

	Although this will make it forget the expansion state of the currently
	invisible nodes between refreshes.

2016-10-14  Attila Torok

	* TextViewerWidget: scrollbar conflict (hangup) resolved + crash fix.

	Explicit (internal) 'scroll lock', scrollbar setup improved.

2016-10-24  Attila Torok

	* Bubble()s deferred to refresh(), not creating QTimers, enabled in
	Express mode.

	At most one after every refresh per component.

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* MainWindow tooltip, label, and layout tweaks.

2016-11-09  Andras Varga

	* Error messages refined (start with capital letter, use apostrophes
	for quoting, etc.)

2016-10-26  Attila Torok

	* Clearing the alpha buffer to 1 at the end of each frame in OsgViewer.

	It was necessary because any transparent items (such as transmission
	rings/spheres, obstacles, labels) drawn on the canvas made the window
	itself transparent (on Wayland/Weston at least), and we don't want that.

2016-10-24  Attila Torok

	* Reduced video recording glitches with alpha.

2016-10-11  Attila Torok

	* ConnectionItem: Some formatting and simplifications.

	Click threshold removed, it's implemented in ModuleCanvasViewer.

2016-10-21  Attila Torok

	* GenericObjectInspector formatting fix.

2016-10-24  Attila Torok

	* << operators for printing std::string and SimTime values to
	QDebug.

2016-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Object inspector: Display the @hint property of fields as a tooltip.

2016-10-11  Attila Torok

	* Better support for editable objects in the object inspector.

2016-10-21  Attila Torok

	* Removed conditions checking for Qt version 5 from qtenv.pro.

2016-10-25  Attila Torok

	* build: Preliminary support for using a Qt bundle in a custom location.

2016-10-21  Attila Torok

	* Wording clarified in the video recording info window.

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change: getImageSize() / getTextExtent(): use doubles for size

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change regarding askyesno(), putsmsg(), alert() etc

2016-10-03  Attila Torok

	* Many graphics items from qtutil.[h|cc] and GraphicsPathArrowItem
	moved into graphicsitems.[h|cc], the latter renamed to ArrowheadItem.

2016-09-30  Attila Torok

	* Fixed [submodules] figure stacking order.

2016-09-30  Attila Torok

	* Implementation of smooth animation.

	Changes include:
	- Animator renamed to MessageAnimator
	- Animation primitives moved to separate files
	- Added DisplayUpdateController
	- Added AnimationParameters window

	Operation in various run modes:

	- "Run" mode:
	If no animationSpeed is specified, the old behaviour
	of alternating frames and events is emulated in Run mode.
	If there is a given animationSpeed:
	Holds are effective, built-in message animations are performed
	(if enabled), the playback speed can be controlled by a slider.

	- "Fast" mode:
	Holds and animationSpeed are ignored, message animations are off,
	the playback speed slider is ineffective, there are no delays
	between events, framerate will be mostly kept near the minimum
	setting. Typically several events are processed between frames.

	- "Express" mode:
	Exactly the same as before.

2016-09-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: Added qtenv.pri file template to the configure process

2016-08-08  Andras Varga

	* Follow cEnvir API change: added placeholders for future implementations
	of getAnimationTime(), getAnimationSpeed(), getRemainingAnimationHoldTime()

2016-09-28  Attila Torok

	* ModuleInspector: Improved refreshing.

2016-09-27  Attila Torok

	* Removed some old cruft, inlined a couple functions
	(mainwin,moduleinsp).

2016-09-21  Attila Torok

	* Enable multisampling antialiasing by default in OsgViewer.

2016-09-22  Attila Torok

	* QtenvOptions defaults moved into the class.

2016-09-20  Attila Torok

	* Some performance improvements throughout.

2016-09-07  Attila Torok

	* Connect the objects of embedded inspectors early enough.

2016-09-07  Attila Torok

	* Prevent setting up a new configuration while the simulation is running.

2016-09-07  Attila Torok

	* Only show the initial 'Set up configuration' dialog once.

2016-09-01  Attila Torok

	* ToolTip is updated upon refresh even if the cursor was not moved.

2016-09-01  Attila Torok

	* Crash fix in CanvasRenderer.

2016-09-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Obey WITH_OSGEARTH: allow disabling the osgEarth integration in
	configure.user while still using OpenSceneGraph.

2016-06-16  Attila Torok

	* OsgViewer rewrite, works with both Qt4 and Qt5. Based on osgQt and
	https://github.com/Submanifold/QtOSG. osgQt is no longer used, it's not
	Qt5 compatible at all. Only tested on Fedora 23/24 x86_64.

2016-08-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Workaround to make the menubar work on Mac OS right after launch.

2016-08-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* Default fonts on Qt5 fixed.

2016-08-31  Andras Varga

	* Added support for self-refreshing figures (cFigure::refreshDisplay())

2016-08-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow Canvas API changes

2016-08-24  Andras Varga

	* Object inspector refinements:
	  1. no "=" for array elements
	  2. fix: no empty quote pair for string arrays
	  3. display info string for root element

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: info() renamed to str()

2016-08-22  Attila Torok

	* Fixes for 'Find Objects' dialog, added as menu option. Inspector
	menus renamed: context -> dropdown.

2016-08-22  Attila Torok

	* Main ObjectInspector always follows inspected object change in
	main ModuleInspector.

2016-08-19  Attila Torok

	* Fixes for SubmoduleItem parsing from DisplayString (range circles,
	position change).

2016-08-08  Attila Torok

	in Qtenv (in module inspector), seems to be enough.

2016-08-10  Attila Torok

	* Canvas: implemented figure tooltip and assocatedObject support

	- Figure tooltip fallback chain:
	   1. Use cFigure::getTooltip() if not empty, else:
	   2. Use tooltip of figure's associatedObject (e.g. associated module's
	      "tt" display string tag) if not empty, else:

	that if a cObject is clicked in any (embedded or toplevel) inspector, the
	embedded object inspector will be set to that object. Also if any cObject
	is double clicked in any (embedded or toplevel) inspector, it will be
	inspected appropriately.

2016-07-18  Attila Torok

2016-04-01  Andras Varga

	* osg: fix: earth scenes did not display in the osg-intro sample

	Root cause: zNear/zFar was not set explicitly in these demos, so it stuck
	with the default values in cOsgCanvas: 1 and 1000.  This caused basically
	all of the scene to be clipped away (out of z range).

	Solution: cOsgCanvas does NOT contain any zNear/zFar by default, only
	when explicitly set. In the viewer, activate near/far autocompute mode
	when cOsgCanvas has no zNear/zFar, otherwise set DO_NOT_COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR.

	Adjusting the aspect ratio in OsgViewer::resizeEvent() is not needed when
	setProjectionResizePolicy(HORIZONTAL) is set.

2016-03-11  Mihaly Palenik

	* Set margin on layout of simTimeLabel and eventNumLabel

2016-03-11  Mihaly Palenik

2016-02-29  Levente Meszaros

	* Changed the background color of the simtime and eventnum labels to
	white.

2016-02-28  Attila Torok

	* StopDialog default position is under the floating toolbar. And its
	  geometry can easily be made persistent.
	* Toolbar event status appearance modified. (layout, frame, font size)
	* Renamed .qtenv.ini to .qtenvrc.

2016-02-26  Mihaly Palenik

	* Follow recent Tkenv changes

2016-02-22  Andras Varga

	* Added fields to the toolbar that display the *current* simulation time
	and event number. Refactored the status bars, and added a status line at
	the bottom. The status bar displays the simulation time of the next event
	along with the difference from the last event. Moved network description
	and message info to the new status line.

	* With the recent simulation kernel changes, printEventBanner() needs to be
	called inside simulationEvent() so that it prints the correct (updated)
	simulation time and event number.

	* When animating, updateStatusDisplay() also needs to be called in
	simulationEvent() so that the correct (updated) simulation time is displayed
	during the animation.

2016-02-14  Attila Torok

	* GenericObjectInspector works with Qt5 now.
	* Added load(moc) to qtenv.pro.

	  anymore.

2016-02-10  Attila Torok

	* logging: LogLevel of Components can be changed, and is saved/restored.
	* Also a small fix regarding switching of run modes.
	* Separate inspector preferences for toplevel and embedded inspectors.
	  The toplevel inspectors will default to the prefs of the embedded ones
	  if they don't have their own values.
	* Restored StopDialog button font size.
	* Context menu in LogInspector for messages, express run until message fixed.

2016-02-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* ColorizeEffect fixed, image figures use it now, zoomLabel painting
	fixed, other small corrections.

2016-02-08  Attila Torok

	is now children. Scrolling fixed yet again. Context menu on green
	background.

2016-01-27  Levente Meszaros

	* OSG: Added call to setComputeNearFarMode() to prevent automatically
	updating zNear and zFar.

2016-01-20  Attila Torok

	* Fixed the interpolation mode of pixmap figures.
	* The zoom label on the module canvas uses the canvas font now.
	* Added hasChildren() to GenericObjectTreeModel. This should make it
	  a bit faster in some cases.

2016-01-13  Attila Torok

	* Double confirmation dialog on Ctrl+Q fixed.
	* ModuleCanvasViewer: Scroll region correction and figure rendering fixes.
	* ModuleCanvasViewer now redraws the compound module upon refresh.
	* Context menu positions corrected.
	* Fixes and improvements to figure and arrowhead rendering.

2016-01-08  Attila Torok

	* Minor corrections in ConnectionItem and OutlinedTextItem.
	* textviewerwidget: Another improvement to scrollbar handling.

2015-12-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed a build error on Windows

2015-12-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* A workaround for a bug where the floating toolbar was not properly
	refreshed on MAC OS X when the inspector window was scrolled.
	Right now we are putting the toolbar above the window on MAC OS X. We
	could switch back to floating toolbar once the refresh issue is solved.

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-12-02  Andras Varga

	* Qtenv is ready for the OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 3 release.

	Most of Qtenv was implemented by Attila Torok and Mihaly Palenik
	between April and August 2015, using Tkenv code as scaffolding.
	It was then refined by them during fall 2015.

	OpenSceneGraph integration was mostly coded by Andras Varga.
	The build system is largely the work of Rudolf Hornig.

2015-04-21  Andras Varga

	* * Added defunct Tkenv code as scaffolding for the code.
	(Tcl_VarEval() and other Tcl API functions have been replaced with
	dummy functions, so the original Tkenv code compiles but does
	nothing for the moment.)

2015-03-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* Qtenv development started: Initial Qt code by Attila Torok.
