 * This is a planar graph embedding for a connected graph component with spanning tree.
 *
 * Vertices are positioned recursively accoring to the spanning tree as follows.
 * The parent vertex is positioned in the center and its sub trees are positioned around it.
 * The parent vertex and each subtree is modelled with a circle and the circles
 * are positioned on the plane by putting one circle next to two already positioned ones.
 * The best circle position for a child subtree circle is the one which minimizes the distance
 * from the parent circle. When all child subtrees are positioned the parent tree is wrapped
 * by the smallest radius circle.
 *
 * The second pass rotates the subtree circles in place to move the weight point of the subtree
 * opposite to the parent.
 *
 * The resulting embedding will not have overlapping vertices.
