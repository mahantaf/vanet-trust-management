	* Refined CsvWriter and JsonWriter classes, used for exporting results
	in respective formats from scavetool and the IDE.

2017-04-04  Andras Varga

	- omnetpp recorders: introduced "itervar" lines
	- SQLite recorder: added runItervar table

2017-03-31  Andras Varga

	entries contain a copy of the parameter assignment lines from omnetpp.ini,
	so their order is important.

	- omnetpp recorders: ensure order of "param" lines in the file mirror the
	  order in the ini file
	- SQLite recorder: added a paramOrder column to the RunParam table.

2017-03-30  Andras Varga

	* SQLite result files: histBin table renamed to histogramBin

2017-04-04  Andras Varga

	* stringutils: opp_formatTable() fix: it printed one more LF than needed

2017-03-16  Andras Varga

	* Added result file writer classes:
	OmnetppScalarFileWriter, OmnetppVectorFileWriter,
	SqliteScalarFileWriter, SqliteVectorFileWriter.

	Factored out from envir's result file manager classes.

	This is needed so that the sim kernel, scavetool and the IDE can
	share the same code for writing result files.

2017-03-04  Andras Varga

	* Added the Statistics and Histogram classes, factored out from the
	scave library. Needed by the result file writers, see next change.

2017-03-07  Andras Varga

	   - fix: expand to ((void)0) in release mode
	   - error message edited for clarity

2017-02-18  Andras Varga

	* Added FormattedPrinter class (useful for printing help in command-line
	programs)

2017-02-21  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: Added opp_split(), opp_formatTable()

2017-02-17  Andras Varga

2016-10-30  Andras Varga

	* Adjustments on error messages

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: more const std::string& arguments instead of const char *.

	We don't like mixing const char * and std::string in method signatures,
	as it results in too many .c_str() at call sites, and in some cases
	prevents optimizing std::string assignments (e.g. refcounting+COW).

2016-10-21  Andras Varga

	* EnumStringIterator (used for resolving run number lists): fix: properly
	skip empty ranges, tolerate spaces. It used to return the start of the
	range, e.g. 5..1 expanded to 5.

2016-10-20  Andras Varga

	* expression.y: accept '=' as alternative to '=='

2016-09-30  Levente Mészáros

	* unitconversion.cc: Added coulomb [C] and related units As, mAs, Ah, mAh.

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* Added stlutil.h

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* matchexpression.h: added MatchableStringMap

	* stringutil.h: opp_indentlines() fix: do not add indent after last line

2016-09-25  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_sanitizeFileName() and opp_filenameencode()

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* The updated build system now uses the ./configure file only to detect
	certain flags and libraries. Most of the build logic is handled by the
	Makefile.inc file itslef. This allows you to enable/disable optional
	components (i.e. Tkenv,Qtenv,OSG and osgEarth support) without even
	re-running the ./configure file.

2016-08-23  Andras Varga

	* stringutil.h: added opp_xmlQuote()

2016-08-22  Andras Varga

	* opp_vsscanf(): %g to mean float not double, for consistency with scanf()

2016-07-15  Andras Varga

	* Expression: evaluator methods made const

2016-07-11  Andras Varga

	* Expression: parser: allow variables with a syntax of module paths,
	i.e. dot-separated sequence of name or name[index] segments.

2016-07-07  Mihaly Palenik

	* stringutil.h: added opp_format() for formatting integers with digit
	groups.

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2016-02-15  Attila Torok

	* Fixed global colors map, it's guaranteed to be constructed before use.

2016-01-18  Andras Varga

	* Added opp_substringbeforelast() and opp_substringafterlast().

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-11-17  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: added femtosecond and attosecond, as they are needed
	for the new simtime-resolution config option.

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-08-10  Attila Torok

	Added the colorutil files with SVG color names, currently used by
	cCanvas and Qtenv.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_strnistr() fix (did not match at the end of the string)

2015-06-19  Andras Varga

	* expression.lex: fix #830 "kernel crashes when adding '//' to parameter
	lines in ini-files". The expression parser was not supposed to support
	"//" comments in the first place

2015-06-11  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: put back kB/MB/GB/TB with the correct (base 10) meaning.
	Note: base 2 units also exist: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB.

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* CommonStringPool renamed to StringPool (due to namespaces, it no longer
	conflicts with StringPools in other source folders)

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2015-02-07  Andras Varga

	During development in the 5.0 branch (2013-2014):

	* stringutil.cc/h: new utility functions: opp_strnistr(), opp_urldecode(),
	opp_makedatetimestring(), opp_join()

	* TRACE macro renamed to TRACE_CALL due to conflict with new module logging API

2014-11-27  ------ omnetpp-4.6 released ------

2013-01-09  Andras Varga

	* Renamed methods of cMatchExpression::Matchable:
	    getDefaultAttribute() -> getAsString()
	    getAttribute(const char *name) -> getAsString(const char *attribute)

2012-10-03  Andras Varga

	* fix in Expression: '-2m' was evaluated to '2' (meter was lost)

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: OR operator made optional.
	E.g. now "Host" or "Router" or "Switch" can be written as "Host Router Switch",
	which is more natural at places (code that so far took a space-separated
	list of possible items, like node selectors in INET's configurator,
	can now be naturally extended to have more power by using
	MatchExpression, without affecting existing users or making OR mandatory).

2012-03-13  ------ omnetpp-4.2.2 released ------

2012-01-17  ------ omnetpp-4.2.1 released ------

2011-10-28  ------ omnetpp-4.2 released ------

	* unitconversion.cc: addressed bug #369:
	- added "mps" (m/s) and "kmph" (km/h) as recognized units.
	- several units have been renamed to be more standards compliant:
	  Kbps -> kbps, KB -> KiB, MB -> MiB, GB -> GiB, TB -> TiB;
	- added explanations to "Cannot convert" error messages about the
	renamed units

2011-05-06  Andras Varga

	* fileutil.cc: fix bug #284: isDirectory() should not throw exception
	if file or directory does not exist

2008-12-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0rc1 released ------

2008-11-26  Andras Varga

	* library renamed to oppcommon ("common" was too common)

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Common library was added in omnetpp-4.0,
	and it contains classes and functions used by all parts of OMNeT++.
