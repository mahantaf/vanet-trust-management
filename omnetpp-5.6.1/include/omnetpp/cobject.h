/**
 * @brief Root of the \opp class hierarchy. cObject is a lightweight class
 * without any data members.
 *
 * cObject and its subclass cOwnedObject define an ownership mechanism.
 * Any cObject may become owner of other objects, but owned objects must be
 * subclassed from cOwnedObject. cObject also contains methods that allow
 * the object to be displayed in graphical user interfaces (Tkenv, Qtenv).
 *
 * It is recommended to use cObject as a base class for any class
 * that has at least one virtual member function. This makes the class more
 * interoperable with \opp, and causes no extra overhead at all.
 * sizeof(cObject) should yield 4 on a 32-bit architecture (4-byte vptr),
 * and using cObject as a base class does not add anything to the size
 * of an object, because a class with a virtual function already has a vptr.
 * Subclasses are expected to redefine member functions such as dup(),
 * str(), forEachChild(), etc.
 *
 * Note: The (cPolymorphic, cObject) classes in \opp versions 2.x and 3.x
 * were renamed to (cObject, cOwnedObject) in version 4.0.
