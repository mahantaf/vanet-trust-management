/**
 * @brief Base class for all simple module classes.
 *
 * cSimpleModule, although packed with simulation-related functionality,
 * does not do anything useful by itself: one has to subclass from it
 * and redefine one or more virtual member functions to make it do useful work.
 * These functions are:
 *
 *    - void initialize()
 *    - void handleMessage(cMessage *msg)
 *    - void activity()
 *    - void finish()
 *
 * initialize() is called after \opp created the module. Multi-stage
 * initialization can be achieved by redefining the initialize(int stage)
 * method instead, and also redefining the numInitStages() const method to
 * return the required number of stages.
 *
 * One has to redefine handleMessage() to contain the internal logic of
 * the module. handleMessage() is called by the simulation kernel when the
 * module receives a message. (An alternative to handleMessage() is
 * activity(), but activity() is not recommended for serious model development
 * because of scalability and debugging issues. activity() also tends to lead
 * to messy module implementations.)
 *
 * You can send() messages to other modules, or use scheduleAt()+cancelEvent()
 * to implement delays, timers or timeouts. Messages sent or scheduled (but
 * not cancelled) are delivered to modules via handleMessage(), or, when using
 * activity(), via receive().
 *
 * The finish() functions are called when the simulation terminates
 * successfully. Typical use of finish() is recording statistics collected
 * during simulation.

     * inputGate->getPathEndGate()). setDeliverOnReceptionStart() needs to be
     * called in advance, for example in the initialize() method of the module.
     * When a module receives a packet, it can call the isReceptionStart() and
