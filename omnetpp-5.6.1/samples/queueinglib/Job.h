/**
 * We extend the generated Job_Base class with support for split-join, as well
 * as the ability to enumerate all jobs in the system.
 *
 * To support split-join, Jobs manage parent-child relationships. A
 * relationship is created with the makeChildOf() or addChild() methods,
 * and lives until the parent or the child Job is destroyed.
 * It can be queried with the getParent() and getNumChildren()/getChild(k)
 * methods.
 *
 * To support enumerating all jobs in the system, each Job automatically
 * registers itself in a JobList module, if one exist in the model.
 * (If there's no JobList module, no registration takes place.) If there
 * are more than one JobList modules, the first one is chosen.
 * JobList can also be explicitly specified in the Job constructor.
 * The default JobList can be obtained with the JobList::getDefaultInstance()
 * method. Then one can query JobList for the set of Jobs currently present.
