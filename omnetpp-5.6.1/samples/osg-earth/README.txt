OSG Earth Demo
==============

This is one of the example simulations that demonstrate 3D visualization in
OMNeT++ using OpenSceneGraph and osgEarth.

The model demonstrates displaying and animating mobile nodes (cows in one
example, and trucks in the other) on a map. The map is loaded from an
.earth file, and mobile nodes are loaded from .osgb files. Both random and
trace-based mobility is demonstrated. Wireless frame transmissions are
visualized with an inflating bubble animation, also loaded from an .osgb
file.

OpenSceneGraph (http://www.openscenegraph.org), or OSG for short, is an
open source high-performance 3D graphics toolkit, used by application
developers in fields such as visual simulation, games, virtual reality,
scientific visualization and modeling.

osgEarth (http://osgearth.org/) is a terrain rendering library implemented
on top of OpenSceneGraph. osgEarth can work with many data sources
including OpenStreetmap, Yahoo Maps, Bing Maps, MapQuest and ReadyMap, just
to name a few.

This example simulation requires the Qtenv runtime environment.
