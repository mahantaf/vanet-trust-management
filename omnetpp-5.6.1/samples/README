This directory contains several simulation models to demonstrate the features
of the simulation framework. These simulations are intentionally kept simple to
facilitate understanding, even at the cost of realism.

There is a step-by-step tutorial (TicToc), some queueing simulations (Fifo,
Queueing, CQN), many that borrow their topic from the field of communication
networks (Aloha, HyperCube, Routing, etc.) and also some that show off features
of the simulation framework (such as NedDemo for topology description, or Canvas
for the 2D graphics API).

The source code for all models are provided for you to study. While we have
done our best to comment the sources, it is probably necessary to browse
through the Simulation Manual before you try to understand them. You will
also find the simulation kernel API reference useful.

We suggest that you start the tour with the TicToc tutorial.
