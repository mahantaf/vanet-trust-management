<h3>The implementation</h3>

<h4>Setup</h4>

<p>
The external interface used in this example simulation is a single TCP socket.
All interesting functionality is in the <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt> class.
Its source code is in csocketrtscheduler.h/cc.

<p>
<tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt> combines synchronizing to real-time with
socket communication. When the simulation starts, the <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt>
object starts to listen on port 4242 (or the one that was
<a href="config.html">configured</a>) for incoming TCP connections.
All connections will be accepted, but only one at a time (the OS serializes
connections on the same socket, and for simplicity we don't open a new socket
or start a new thread whenever one connection gets established.)

<h4>Synchronization and receiving</h4>

<p>
Then normal real-time simulation will begin, except that <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt>
will use <tt>select()</tt> instead of <tt>usleep()</tt> to wait, so that it
always learns immediately whenever some data arrives on the socket.

<p>
When data arrives on the socket, it will be received into a buffer
(a byte array), the current time/date will be remembered, and a given
<tt>cMessage</tt> object will be scheduled (put into the FES)
with the simulation time that corresponds to the current time
for the dedicated "interface module". The scheduler function
then returns, and the new simulation event will be immediately executed
in exactly the same way as any other event would.

<p>
At the beginning of the simulation, the <tt>extClient</tt> simple module
(which is of class <tt>ExtHTTPClient</tt> or <tt>ExtTelnetClient</tt>)
had registered itself with <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt> as the
dedicated "interface module". So it's this module that will receive
the event, just as a normal self-message.

<p>
From the self-message it knows that it has to look into the buffer
for the bytes that were received, and it will convert them to a simulated
packet (e.g. a <tt>HTTPMsg</tt> or <tt>TelnetPkt</tt> in this model).
The packet then gets sent on the <tt>"out"</tt> gate into the simulated
network, just as it would on any other OMNeT++/OMNEST simulation.

<h4>Sending</h4>

<p>
When the <tt>extClient</tt> module receives a packet (e.g. HTTP reply)
from the server on the simulated network, it has to relay it via the
socket back to the external process. So it first converts the message
to a byte array (e.g. gets the HTTP reply from the <tt>HTTPMsg</tt>
object), and invokes a <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt> method to send it
on the socket.

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>
As you can see, the scheduler object has to work together closely with
the interface module. At the beginning, the interface module
has to find the scheduler object, cast it to the appropriate type,
and register itself. In the registration call
(<tt>rtScheduler->setInterfaceModule(...)</tt> below) it also passes
the scheduler the address and length of the buffer (<tt>recvBuffer</tt>,
<tt>4000</tt>) as well as the message it wants to get back as a
self-message whenever data arrive from the socket. This is done by the
following code, found in the <tt>initialize()</tt> functions of
<tt>ExtHTTPClient</tt> and <tt>ExtTelnetClient</tt>:

<pre>
rtScheduler = check_and_cast&lt;cSocketRTScheduler *&gt;(simulation.scheduler());
cMessage *rtEvent = new cMessage("rtEvent");
rtScheduler-&gt;setInterfaceModule(this, rtEvent, recvBuffer, 4000, &amp;numRecvBytes);
</pre>

<p>
<b>Notice that this registration function and even the notion of a dedicated
interface module are specific to this particular
example simulation. <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt> is just an example, and
it was deliberately made as simple as possible to facilitate understanding.
In real-life applications, you can (and will probably have to) create
much more sophisticated hardware-in-the-loop scheduler classes.</b>
