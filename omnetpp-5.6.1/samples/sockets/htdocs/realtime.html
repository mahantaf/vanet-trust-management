<h3>Real-time simulation</h3>

<p>
The word "real-time" means that the simulation is executed in a way such that
simulation time is synchronized to real time: simulating one second
in the model will also take one "real" second. This is in contrast to
"normal" simulation, when we want the simulation to run as fast as possible.

<p>
To implement real-time simulation, one has to establish a relationship between
real time and simulation. For example, one has to remember the date/time
when the simulation was started as <i>T<sub>0</sub></i>, and then arrange so that
during simulation, an event with simulation time <i>t</i> gets executed
at real time <i>T<sub>0</sub>+t</i>. Practically this means that
just before executing every event, one needs to introduce some amount of waiting,
using e.g. Unix <tt>usleep()</tt> calls. In OMNeT++/OMNEST, this waiting is embedded
into the scheduler class. The Dyna/Real-Time example uses the <tt>cRealtimeScheduler</tt>
class, and this one uses <tt>cSocketRealTimeScheduler</tt> which also takes care
of other tasks necessary in hardware-in-the-loop simulation.
