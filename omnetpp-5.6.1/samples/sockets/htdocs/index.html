<h3>The Sockets Demo</h3>

<p>
This is an example how one can implement hardware-in-the-loop simulation
with OMNeT++/OMNEST. Hardware-in-the-loop means that some external device
is taking part in the simulation, or in other scenarios, the simulation
program emulates a device which is part of the real system. In this example
simulation, it will be an external process (a web browser or
a telnet client) that participates in the simulation.

<p>
This example contains two simulation models:

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="httpmodel.html">HTTP</a> model (the one you're currently
      running)
  <li>The <a href="telnetmodel.html">Telnet</a> model
</ul>

<p>
Both simulations are executed in <a href="realtime.html">real-time</a>,
that is, simulation time is synchronized to real (wall clock) time.
Also, you can connect into the simulation with the web browser or
the telnet program, and generate traffic on the simulated network.
Read more about the principle <a href="hwintheloop.html">here</a>.

<p>
It is recommended that you set animation speed to near maximum (using the
slider at the top of the graphics window) for the simulation to be able
to keep up with real time. Then you can check on the performance gauge bar:
the simsec/sec gauge should stay around 1.0.

<p>
This example simulation is just a toy, but it's not difficult to see
how one could change it into something useful. For example, if one
changes the TCP socket interface to grabbing and sending raw Ethernet
frames, a simulation can be made to receive and generate traffic
on the local network. It is essential though that the computer running
the simulation has enough processing power to keep up with real time,
and communication latencies at the external interface be small enough
and properly accounted for in the model.

<p>
At the heart of this simulation is the <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt> class,
which OMNeT++/OMNEST was <a href="config.html">configured</a> to use
as scheduler. The "external client" simple modules (<tt>ExtHTTPClient</tt>,
<tt>ExtTelnetClient</tt>) then rely on <tt>cSocketRTScheduler</tt>
for keeping in touch with the external process (browser or telnet).
