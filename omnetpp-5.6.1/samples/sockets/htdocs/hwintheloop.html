<h3>Hardware-in-the-loop simulation</h3>

<p>
Hardware-in-the-loop simulation has two ingredients:

<ol>
 <li> the simulation has to be synchronized to real time;

 <li> there has to be a way the simulation can communicate with the real world:
   it has to be able to receive external events, and possibly also to send
   events out of the simulation.
</ol>

<p>
The implementation of external communication in (2) can be very different
from one simulation scenario to another. It can be as simple as TCP sockets
(as here) or pipes, it can be raw communication on an Ethernet NIC or an USB port,
or communication with a interface card via interrupts and DMA transfer.
If you plan to do hardware-in-the-loop simulation, you'll most likely have to
implement your own external communication interface.

<p>
The implementation is based on <a href="realtime.html">real-time simulation</a>,
but there is an important difference: during waiting, the scheduler has to
stay tuned and watch if something of importance arrives on the external
communication interface. If it does, it immediately has to be converted into
a simulation event, and injected into the simulation model with a simulation
time that corresponds to the real time in that moment. The scheduler of course
has to have a built-in knowledge of how to convert external events into
simulation messages, and to which module the event has to be delivered.

<p>
Outbound communication does not necessarily have to go through the scheduler
object, but because inbound and outbound communications are often not
independent (e.g. they may be implemented as send and receive operations
on the same socket), it is often practical to do both via the scheduler.
