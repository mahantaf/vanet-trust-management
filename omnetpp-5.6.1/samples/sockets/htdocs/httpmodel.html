<h3>The HTTP model</h3>

<p>
HTTPNet models a network where several clients send HTTP requests to a
web server, which replies with the appropriate web pages or 404 Not Found.
(The simulation is performed on a very abstract level: TCP or IP details
are not simulated at all, etc.) Most HTTP clients are simulated ones,
but one of them is a proxy which represents a real-life user (that is,
you): by pointing your browser to <tt>http://localhost:4242</tt> while the
simulation is running, you can inject real HTTP requests into the
simulated network.

<p>
To try:

<ul>
  <li> start the simulation with the "Run" button on the toolbar
  <li> fire up your browser, and point it to: <tt>http://localhost:4242</tt>
  <li> then watch how your HTTP requests get into the simulated network
</ul>

<p>
It is also possible to stop the simulation when a packet is underway, and
peek into it.
