OSG Indoor Demo
===============

This is one of the example simulations that demonstrate 3D visualization in
OMNeT++ using OpenSceneGraph.

The model demonstrates visualizing an indoor mobility scenario. The 3D
office model is loaded from an .osgb file. Mobile nodes (walking cardboard
box men) are also loaded from an .osgb file that also includes the
animation, and move along a path loaded from a trace file.

OpenSceneGraph (http://www.openscenegraph.org), or OSG for short, is an
open source high-performance 3D graphics toolkit, used by application
developers in fields such as visual simulation, games, virtual reality,
scientific visualization and modeling.

This example simulation requires the Qtenv runtime environment.
