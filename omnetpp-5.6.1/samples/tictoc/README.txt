TicToc
======

NOTE:
   This example simulation is accompanied by the TicToc Tutorial
   which can be found in the the documentation.

TicToc contains a series of simulation models numbered 1 through 12. The
models are of increasing complexity -- they start from the basics and
introduce new OMNeT++ features or simulation techniques in each step.
The additions are well commented, so the model sources can help you
build up a good working knowledge of OMNeT++ in a short time.

Each model is self-contained, with its number in the file names, so e.g.
TicToc-3 consists of tictoc3.ned and txc3.cc. (The omnetpp.ini file is shared
among all models). The makefile is set up so that the executable contains all
simulation models, and when you start it you can choose which model you
want to run. It is recommended that you first read the source code of the
given simulation (say tictoc3.ned and txc3.cc), then run it and find out
what it does and why.
