Note to maintainers
-------------------

The ResultAnalysisUsingPython.md file is a Jupyter notebook, maintained in 
Markdown format for easier editing and version control. The "notedown" tool 
is used to convert it from Markdown to Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format 
(https://github.com/aaren/notedown).

DO NOT PUBLISH THE MARKDOWN FILE DIRECTLY TO WEB. IT WILL MISS THE OUTPUTS OF THE COMMANDS.

Notedown can be installed with 'pip install notedown'. In theory Jupyter 
could also be convinced to save directly in Markdown (thus sparing the conversion), 
but I could not get it to work.

To convert for viewing/editing in Jupyter:

notedown --match=fenced ResultAnalysisUsingPython.md -o tmp.ipynb

To convert back, e.g. after editing in Jupyter:

notedown --to markdown tmp.ipynb -o ResultAnalysisUsingPython.md

When opened in Jupyter, run all cells to get the outputs. Then you can
export it as HTML, Markdown with outputs, or pdf.
