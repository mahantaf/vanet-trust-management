Check network name lookup in inifiles. Simple names are checked
first in the inifile's package, then in the default package.

Test that it's found in the default package

%file: foo/bar/test.ned
package foo.bar;

network TestNet {
}

%file: test.cc
// so that linker gets some input

%inifile: foo/bar/test.ini
[General]
network = TestNet  # should be understood as foo.bar.TestNet
cmdenv-express-mode = false
