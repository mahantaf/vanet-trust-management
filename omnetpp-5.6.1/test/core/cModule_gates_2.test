%description:
Test that gates in a gate vector can be accessed by id=baseId+index,
and that ids out of range generate proper error messages.

static void printGates(cModule *mod, const char *gatename)
{
    int baseId = mod->gate(gatename,0)->getId();
    int size = mod->gateSize(gatename);
    for (int i=-3; i<size+3; i++) {
