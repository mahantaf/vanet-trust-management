[Config Smooth]
description = No-op events only

[Config RegularJerks]
description = A small skip every second.

[Config RegularLongJerks]
description = Siginificant jerks, but simTime should keep up.

[Config RegularShortJerks]
description = Smaller skips, more often, simTime should still (barely) keep up.

[Config OverloadedSlow]
description = SimTime can't progresss faster than half real time, animation can't be smoother than 10 fps.

description = There is a short hold after each processed event.
