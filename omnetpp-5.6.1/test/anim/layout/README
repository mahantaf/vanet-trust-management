Tests auto-layouting capability in Tkenv.

Currently problematic ones:
- net60 oscillates around a stable solution
- dyna for n>10 is total failure
- networkLayers is total failure

In general, when there're many anchored nodes, they cause the graph
oscillate wildly...

bug in springembedderlayout: forces applied to an anchor must
be divided by the number of nodes attached to the anchor
