Model for testing refreshDisplay(). 
Rules:
1. it should be invoked after network setup (intitialization), network finalization (finish()), 
   and every time the display is updated after processing one or more events
2. throwing an exception from refreshDisplay() should result in a simulation error
3. refreshDisplay() must NOT be invoked at all after the simulation has stopped with an error (cRuntimeError)
