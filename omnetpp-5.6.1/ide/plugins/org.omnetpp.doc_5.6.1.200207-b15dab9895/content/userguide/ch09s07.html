      This section will guide you through the use of the Sequence Chart and Eventlog Table
      tools, using example simulations from OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ and the INET Framework.
      Before running any of the simulations, make sure that eventlog recording is
      enabled by adding the line </p><pre class="screen">record-eventlog = true</pre><p>
      in the <code class="filename">omnetpp.ini</code> file in the simulation's directory. To open the
      generated eventlog in the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ IDE, go to the example's
      <code class="filename">results</code> directory in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Resource
      Navigator</em></span> View, and double-click the log file. By default, the file
      will open in the Sequence Chart.
      </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
  To open the file in the Eventlog Table as editor, right-click the file, and
  choose the corresponding item from the context menu's <span class="emphasis"><em>Open With</em></span>
  submenu.

    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4068"></a>Tictoc</h3></div></div></div><p>
  The Tictoc example is available in the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ installation under the directory
  <code class="filename">samples/tictoc</code>. Tictoc is the most basic example in this
  chapter and it provides a quick overview on how to use and understand the Sequence
  Chart.
      </p><p>
  Start the simulation and choose the simplest configuration, 'Tictoc1', which
  specifies only two nodes called 'tic' and 'toc.' During initialization, one of the
  nodes will send a message to the other. From then on, every time a node
  receives the message, it will simply send it back. This process continues until
  you stop the simulation. In <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-TicTocTwoNodes.png" title="Figure 9.15.  Tictoc with two nodes">Figure 9.15, &#8220;
  Tictoc with two nodes
      &#8221;</a> you can see how
  this is represented on a Sequence Chart. The two horizontal black lines correspond
  to the two nodes and are labeled 'tic' and 'toc.' The red circles represent
  events and the blue arrows represent message sends. It is easy to see that all
  message sends take 100 milliseconds and that the first sender is the node 'tic.'
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-TicTocTwoNodes.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.15.

  In the next Tictoc example, there are six nodes tossing a message around until it
  reaches its destination. To generate the eventlog file, restart the simulation and
  choose the configuration 'Tictoc9'. In <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-TicTocSeveralNodes.png" title="Figure 9.16.  Tictoc with six nodes">Figure 9.16, &#8220;
  Tictoc with six nodes
      &#8221;</a> you can see how
  the message goes from one node to another, starting from node '0' and passing through it
  twice more, until it finally reaches its destination, node
  '3.' The chart also shows that this example, unlike the previous one, starts with a
  self-message instead of immediately sending a message from initialize to another
  node.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-TicTocSeveralNodes.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.16.

  Let us demonstrate with this simple example how filtering works with the Sequence
  Chart. Open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Filter Dialog</em></span> with the toolbar button <span class="guibutton"><img src="icons/filter.png"></span>
  and put a checkmark for node '0' and '3' on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Module filter|by
  name</em></span> panel, and apply it. The chart now displays only two axes that
  correspond to the two selected nodes.  Note that the arrows on this figure are
  decorated with zigzags, meaning that they represent a sequence of message
  sends. Such arrows will be called virtual message sends in the rest of this
  chapter.  The first two arrows show the message returning to node '0' at
  
   event #9 and 
   event #13, and the third
  shows that it reaches the destination at 
   event #16.  The
  events where the message was in between are filtered out.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-TicTocSeveralNodesFiltered.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.17. 
  Filtering for node '0' and '3'

  The FIFO example is available in the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ installation under the directory
  <code class="filename">samples/fifo</code>. The FIFO is an important example because it
  uses a queue, which is an essential part of discrete event simulations and
  introduces the notion of message reuses.
      </p><p>
  When you start the simulation, choose the configuration 'low job arrival rate' and
  let it run for a while. In <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFO.png" title="Figure 9.18.  The FIFO example">Figure 9.18, &#8220;
  The FIFO example
      &#8221;</a> you can see three modules: a
  'source', a 'queue', and a 'sink.' The simulation starts with a self-message and
  then the generator sends the first message to the queue at
  
   event #1. It is immediately obvious that the message stays in
  the queue for a certain period of time, between 
   event #2 and
  
   event #3.
      </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
  When you select one event and hover with the mouse above the other,
  the Sequence Chart will show the length of this time period in a tooltip.
      </div><p>
  Finally, the message is sent to the 'sink' where it is
  deleted at 
   event #4.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFO.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.18. 
  The FIFO example
      </b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFO.png" align="middle" alt="The FIFO example"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
  Something interesting happens at 
   event #12 where the incoming
  message suddenly disappears. It seems like the queue does not send the message
  out. Actually, what happens is that the queue enqueues the job because it is busy
  serving the message received at 
   event #10.  Since this queue
  is a FIFO, it will send out the first message at 
   event #13. To
  see how this happens, turn on <span class="emphasis"><em>Show Reuse Messages</em></span> from the
  context menu; the result is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFOReuse.png" title="Figure 9.19.  Showing reuse messages">Figure 9.19, &#8220;
  Showing reuse messages
      &#8221;</a>.  It displays a couple
  of green dotted arrows, one of which starts at 
   event #12 and
  arrives at 
   event #17. This is a reuse arrow; it means that the
  message sent out from the queue at 
   event #17 is the same as
  the one received and enqueued at 
   event #12.  Note that the
  service of this message actually begins at 
   event #13, which is
  the moment that the queue becomes free after it completes the job
  received at 
   event #10.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFOReuse.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.19.

      </b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFOReuse.png" align="middle" alt="Showing reuse messages"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
  Another type of message reuse is portrayed with the arrow
  from 
   event #3 to 
   event #6.
  The arrow shows that the queue reuses
  the same timer message instead of creating a new one each time.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        Whenever you see a reuse arrow, it means that the underlying implementation
        remembers the message between the two events. It might be stored
        in a pointer variable, a queue, or some other data structure.
      </div><p>
  The last part of this example is about filtering out the queue from the
  chart. Open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Filter Dialog</em></span>, select 'sink'
  and 'source' on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Module filter|by NED type</em></span> panel, and
  apply the change in settings. If you look at the result in <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFOFiltered.png" title="Figure 9.20.  Filtering the queue">Figure 9.20, &#8220;
  Filtering the queue
      &#8221;</a>, you will see
  zigzag arrows going from the 'source' to the 'sink.' These arrows show
  that a message is being sent through the queue from 'source' to 'sink.' The
  first two arrows do not overlap in simulation time, which means the queue did not
  have more than one message during that time. The third
  and fourth arrows do overlap because the fourth job reached the queue
  while it was busy with the third one. Scrolling forward you can find other places
  where the queue becomes empty and the arrows do not overlap.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-FIFOFiltered.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.20.

  The Routing example is available in the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ installation under the directory
  <code class="filename">samples/routing</code>. The predefined configuration called 'Net10'
  specifies a network with 10 nodes with each node having an application, a few
  queues and a routing module inside. Three preselected nodes, namely the node '1,'
  '6,' and '8' are destinations, while all nodes are message sources. The routing
  module uses the shortest path algorithm to find the route to the destination. The
  goal in this example is to create a sequence chart that shows messages which
  travel simultaneously from multiple sources to their destinations.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-RoutingNetwork.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.21.

  Since we do not care about the details regarding what happens within nodes, we can simply turn
  on filtering for the NED type 'node.Node.' The chart will have 10 axes with each axis
  drawn as two parallel solid black lines close to each other. These are the
  compound modules that represent the nodes in the network. So far events could be
  directly drawn on the simple module's axis where they occurred, but now they will
  be drawn on the compound module's axis of their ancestor.
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-Routing.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.22.

  To reduce clutter, the chart will automatically omit events which are internal to
  a compound module. An event is internal to a compound module if it only processes
  a message from, and sends out messages to, other modules inside the compound
  module.
      </p><p>
  If you look at <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-Routing.png" title="Figure 9.22.  Filtering for nodes">Figure 9.22, &#8220;
  Filtering for nodes
      &#8221;</a> you
  will see a message going from node '7' at 
   event #10 to node
  '1' at 
   event #23. This message stays in node '2'
  between 
   event #15 and 
   event #17.
  The gray background area between them means that zero simulation time has
  elapsed (i.e. the model does not account for processing time inside the
  network nodes).
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        This model contains both finite propagation delay and transmission time;
        arrows in the sequence chart correspond to the interval between the start
        of the transmission and the end of the reception.
      </div><p>
  This example also demonstrates message detail recording configured by
  </p><pre class="screen">eventlog-message-detail-pattern = Packet:declaredOn(Packet)</pre><p> in
  the INI file. The example in <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-RoutingTooltip.png" title="Figure 9.23.  Message detail tooltip">Figure 9.23, &#8220;
  Message detail tooltip

  It is very easy to find another message on the chart that goes through the network
  parallel in simulation time. The one sent from node '3' at
  
   event #13 to node '8' arriving at
  
   event #19 is such a message.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4183"></a>Wireless</h3></div></div></div><p>
  The Wireless example is available in the INET Framework under the directory
  <code class="filename">examples/adhoc/ieee80211</code>. The predefined configuration called
  'Config1' specifies two mobile hosts moving around on the playground and
  communicating via the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol. The network devices are
  configured for ad-hoc mode and the transmitter power is set so that hosts can
  move out of range. One of the hosts is continuously pinging the other.
      </p><p>
  In this section, we will explore the protocol's MAC layer, using two sequence
  charts. The first chart will show a successful ping message being sent through the
  wireless channel. The second chart will show ping messages getting lost and being
  continuously re-sent.
      </p><p>
  We also would like to record some message details during the simulation. To perform
  that function, comment out the following line from <code class="literal">omnetpp.ini</code>:
  </p><pre class="screen">eventlog-message-detail-pattern = *:(not declaredOn(cMessage) and not
  declaredOn(cNamedObject) and not declaredOn(cObject))</pre><p>
      </p><p>
  To generate the eventlog file, start the simulation environment and choose the
  configuration 'host1 pinging host0.' Run the simulation in fast mode until about
  
   event #5000.
      </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm4192"></a>Preparing the Result</h4></div></div></div><p>
    When you open the Sequence Chart, it will show a couple of self-messages named
    'move' being scheduled regularly. These are self-messages that control the
    movement of the hosts on the playground. There is an axis labeled 'pingApp,'
    which starts with a 'sendPing' message that is processed in an event far away on
    the chart. This is indicated by a split arrow.
  </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-WirelessBeginning.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.24.

    You might notice that there are only three axes in <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-WirelessBeginning.png" title="Figure 9.24.  The beginning">Figure 9.24, &#8220;
    The beginning
  &#8221;</a> even though
    the simulation model clearly contains more simple modules. This is because the
    Sequence Chart displays the first few events by default and in this scenario,
    they all happen to be within those modules. If you scroll forward or zoom out,
    new axes will be added automatically as needed.
  </p><p>
    For this example, ignore the 'move' messages and focus on the MAC layer instead. To begin
    with, open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Filter Dialog</em></span>, select
    'Ieee80211Mac' and 'Ieee80211Radio' on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Module filter|by NED
    type</em></span> panel, and apply the selected changes. The chart will have four axes, two for the
    MAC and two for the radio simple modules.
  </p><p>
    The next step is to attach vector data to these axes. Open the context menu for
    each axis by clicking on them one by one and select the <span class="emphasis"><em>Attach Vector
    to Axis</em></span> submenu. Accept the vector file offered by default. Then,
    choose the vector 'mac:State' for the MAC modules and 'mac:RadioState' for the
    radio modules. You will have to edit the filter in the vector selection dialog
    (i.e. delete the last segment) for the radio modules because at the moment the
    radio state is recorded by the MAC module, so the default filter will
    not be right. When this step is completed, the chart should display four thick
    colored bars as module axes. The colors and labels on the bars specify the state
    of the corresponding state machine at the given simulation time.
  </p><p>
    To aid comprehension, you might want to manually reorder the axis, so
    that the radio modules are put next to each other. Use the button <span class="guibutton"><img src="icons/axisordering.gif"></span> on the toolbar to switch to manual ordering. With a
    little zooming and scrolling, you should be able to fit the first message
    exchange between the two hosts into the window.
  </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm4213"></a>Successful Ping</h4></div></div></div><p>
    The first message sent by 'host1' is not a ping request but an ARP request. The
    processing of this message in 'host0' generates the corresponding ARP
    reply. This is shown by the zigzag arrow between 
   event #85
    and 
   event #90. The reply goes back to 'host1,' which then
    sends a WLAN acknowledge in return. In this process, 'host1' discovers the MAC
    address of 'host0' based on its IP address.
  </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-WirelessARP.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.25.

    The send procedure for the first ping message starts at
    
   event #105 in 'host1' and finishes by receiving the
    acknowledge at 
   event #127. The ping reply send procedure
    starts at 
   event #125 in 'host0' and finishes by receiving
    the WLAN acknowledge at 
   event #144. If you scroll
    forward, you can see as in <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-WirelessSuccessfulPing.png" title="Figure 9.26.  The second ping procedure">Figure 9.26, &#8220;
    The second ping procedure
  &#8221;</a> the
    second complete successful ping procedure between 
   event #170
    and 
   event #206. To focus on the second successful ping
    message exchange, open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Filter Dialog</em></span> and enter these
    numbers in the range filter.
  </p><p>
    Timing is critical in a protocol implementation, so we will take a look at it
    using the Sequence Chart. The first self message represents the fact that the
    MAC module listens to the radio for a DIFS period before sending the message
    out. The message send from 
   event #171 to
    
   event #172 occurs in zero simulation time as indicated by
    the gray background. It represents the moment when the MAC module decides to
    send the ping request down to its radio module. The back-off procedure was
    skipped for this message because there was no transmission during the DIFS
    period. If you look at 
   event #172 and
    
   event #173, you will see how the message propagates through
    the air from 'radio1' to 'radio0.' This finite amount of time is calculated from
    the physical distance of the two modules and the speed of light. In addition, by looking at
    
   event #172 and 
   event #174, you will notice
    that the transmission time is not zero. This time interval is calculated from
    the message's length and the radio module's bitrate.
  </p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-WirelessSuccessfulPing.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.26.

    Another interesting fact seen in the figure is
    that the higher level protocol layers do not add delay for generating the ping
    reply message in 'host0' between 
   event #176 and
    
   event #183. The MAC layer procedure ends with sending back a
    WLAN acknowledge after waiting a SIFS period.
  </p><p>
    Finally, you can get a quick overview of the relative timings of the IEEE
    802.11 protocol by switching to linear timeline mode. Use the button <span class="guibutton"><img src="icons/timelinemode.png"></span> on the toolbar and notice how the figure changes
    dramatically. You might need to scroll and zoom in or out to see the
    details. This shows the usefulness of the nonlinear timeline mode.

    To see how the chart looks when the ping messages get lost in the air, first
    turn off range filtering. Then, go to 
   event #1269 by
    selecting the <span class="emphasis"><em>Goto Event</em></span> option from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Eventlog Table</em></span> View's context menu. In <a class="xref" href="ch09s07.html#pictures/SequenceChart-Examples-WirelessUnsuccessfulPing.png" title="Figure 9.27.  Ping messages get lost">Figure 9.27, &#8220;
    Ping messages get lost
  &#8221;</a> you can
    see how the receiver radio does not send up the incoming message to its MAC
    layer due to the signal level being too low. This actually happens at
    
   event #1274 in 'host0.' Shortly thereafter, the transmitter
    MAC layer in 'host1' receives the timeout message at
    
   event #1275, and starts the backoff procedure before
    resending the very same ping message. This process goes on with statistically
    increasing backoff time intervals until 
   event #1317. Finally,
    the maximum number of retries is reached and the message is dropped.
