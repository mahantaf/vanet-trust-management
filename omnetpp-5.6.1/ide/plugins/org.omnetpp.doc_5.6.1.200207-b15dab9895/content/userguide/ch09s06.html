      Both the Sequence Chart and the Eventlog Table tools can be used as an editor and
      also as a view. The difference between an editor or a view is quite important
      because there is only at most one instance of a view of the same kind. It means that
      even if multiple eventlog files are open in Sequence Chart editors, there is no
      more than one <span class="emphasis"><em>Eventlog Table</em></span> view shared between them. This single view will
      automatically display the eventlog file of the active editor. It will also remember
      its position and state when it switches among editors. For more details
      on editors and views, and their differences, please refer to the
      Eclipse documentation.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
	Despite the name "editor", which is a concept of the Eclipse platform, neither the
	Sequence Chart, nor the Eventlog Table can be used to actually change the contents
	of an eventlog file.
      </div><p>
    </p><p>
      It is possible to open the same eventlog file in multiple editors and to navigate
      to different locations, or use different display modes or filters in a location. Once an
      eventlog is open in an editor, you can use the <span class="emphasis"><em>Window|New
      Editor</em></span> to open it again.
      </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
	Dragging one of the editors from the tabbed pane to the side of the editor's area
	allows you to interact with the two simultaneously.
      </div><p>
    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4040"></a>Settings</h3></div></div></div><p>
	There are various settings for both tools which affect the display, such as
	display modes, content position, filter parameters, etc. These user-specified
	settings are automatically saved for each file and they are reused whenever the
	file is revisited. The per file settings are stored under the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+
	workspace, in the directory
	<code class="filename">.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.projects\&lt;project-name&gt;</code>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4044"></a>Large File Support</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Since an eventlog file might be several Gigabytes, both tools are designed in a way
	that allows for efficient displaying of such a file without requiring large amounts of
	physical memory to load it at once. As you navigate through the file, physical
	memory is filled up with the content lazily. Since it is difficult to reliably
	identify when the system is getting low on physical memory, it is up to the user to
	release the allocated memory when needed. This operation, although usually not
	required, is available from the context menu as <span class="emphasis"><em>Release
	Memory</em></span>. It does not affect the user interface in any way.
      </p><p>
	The fact that the eventlog file is loaded lazily and optionally filtered also
	means that the exact number of lines and events it contains cannot be easily
	determined. This affects the way scrollbars work in the lazy directions: horizontal
	for the Sequence Chart and vertical for the Eventlog Table. These
	scrollbars act as a non-linear approximation in that direction. For the most,
	the user will be unaware of these approximations unless the file is really small.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4049"></a>Viewing a Running Simulation's Results</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Even though the simulation kernel keeps the eventlog file open for writing while the
	simulation is running, it may be open in the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ IDE simultaneously. Both
	tools can be guided by pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>END</strong></span> key to follow the
	eventlog's end as new content is appended to it. If you pause the simulation in
	the runtime environment, then after a few seconds the tools will refresh their
	content and jump to the very end. This process makes it possible to follow
	the simulation step-by-step on the Sequence Chart.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4053"></a>Caveats</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Sometimes, drawing the Sequence Chart may take a lot of time. Zooming out too much,
	for example, might result in slow response times. A dialog might pop up telling the user
	that a long running eventlog operation is in progress. You can safely cancel these
	operations at any time you like, or just wait until they finish. To restart the
	rendering process, simply press the refresh button <span class="guibutton"><img src="icons/refresh.gif"></span> on
	the toolbar. Before refreshing, it is a good idea to revert to some
	defaults (e.g. default zoom level) or revert the last changes (e.g. navigate back,
	turn filter off, etc.).
      </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3>
	An operation which runs for an unreasonably long time might be a sign of a
	problem that should be reported.
