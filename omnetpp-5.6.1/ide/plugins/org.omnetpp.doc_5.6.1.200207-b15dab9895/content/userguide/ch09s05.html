      The content of an eventlog can be filtered within the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ IDE. This is
      on-the-fly filtering as opposed to the file content filtering provided by the <code class="literal">Eventlog</code>
      tool. To use on the fly filtering, open the filter configuration dialog with the
      button <span class="guibutton"><img src="icons/filter.png"></span> on the toolbar, enable some of the range, module,
      message, or trace filters, set the various filter parameters, and apply the settings. The
      result is another eventlog, resident in memory, that filters out some events.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
	Similar to the command line <code class="literal">Eventlog</code> tool described in the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ Manual,
	the in-memory filtering can only filter out whole events.
      </div><p>
    </p><p>
      In-memory, on-the-fly filtering means that the filter's result is not saved into an
      eventlog file, but it is computed and stored within memory. This
      allows rapid switching between different views of the same eventlog within both the
      Sequence Chart and the Eventlog Table.
    </p><p>
      The filter configuration dialog shown in <a class="xref" href="ch09s05.html#pictures/SequenceChart-FilterDialog.png" title="Figure 9.14.  Filter Dialog">Figure 9.14, &#8220;
      Filter Dialog
    &#8221;</a> has many options. They are organized into
      a tree with each part restricting the eventlog's content. The individual filter
      components may be turned on and off independent of each other. This allows
      remembering the filter settings even if some of them are temporarily unused.
    </p><p>
      The combination of various filter options might be complicated and hard to
      understand. To make it easier, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Filter Dialog</em></span> automatically
      displays the current filter in a human readable form at the bottom of the dialog.

	This is the simplest filter, which filters out events from the beginning and
	end of the eventlog. It might help to reduce the computation time dramatically
	when defining filters, which otherwise would be very expensive to compute for the
	whole eventlog file.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4010"></a>Module Filter</h3></div></div></div><p>
	With this kind of filter, you can filter out events that did not occur in any of
	the specified modules. The modules which will be included in the result can be
	selected by their NED type, full path, module id, or by a match expression. The
	expression may refer to the raw data present in the lines marked with 'MC' in the
	eventlog file.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4013"></a>Message Filter</h3></div></div></div><p>
	This filter is the most complicated one. It allows filtering for events, which
	either process or send specific messages. The messages can be selected based on
	their C&#8288;+&#8288;+ class name, message name, various message ids, and a match expression.
	The expression may refer to the raw data present in the lines marked with 'BS' in
	the eventlog file.
      </p><p>
	There are four different message ids to filter, each with different
	characteristics. The most basic one is the id, which is unique for each
	constructed message independent of how it was created. The tree id is special
	because it gets copied over when a message is created by copying (duplicating)
	another. The encapsulation id is different in that it gives the id of the
	innermost encapsulated message. Finally, the encapsulation tree id combines the
	two by providing the innermost encapsulated message's tree id.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4017"></a>Tracing Causes/Consequences</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The trace filter allows filtering for causes and consequence of a particular event
	specified by its event number. The cause/consequence relation between two events
	means that there is a message send/reuse path from the cause event to the
	consequence event. If there was a message reuse in the path, then the whole path
	is considered to be a message reuse itself.
      </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3>
	Since computing the causes and consequences in an eventlog file that is far away from the
	traced event might be a time consuming task, the user can set extra range limits around
	the traced event. These limits are separate from the range filter due to
	being relative to the traced event. This means that if you change the traced event,
	there is no need to change the range parameters. It is strongly recommended that users
	provide these limits when tracing events to avoid long running operations.
      </div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4021"></a>Collection Limits</h3></div></div></div><p>
	When an in-memory filter is applied to an eventlog, it does not only filter out
	events, but it also provides automatic discovery for virtual message sends. It
	means that two events far away, and not directly related to each other, might have
	a virtual message send (or reuse) between them. Recall that there is a virtual
	message send (or reuse) between two events if and only if there is a path of
	message sends (or reuses) connecting the two.
      </p><p>
	The process of collecting these virtual message dependencies is time consuming and
	thus has to be limited. There are two options. The first one limits the number of
	virtual message sends collected per event. The other one limits the depth of
	cause/consequence chains during collection.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4025"></a>Long-Running Operations</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Sometimes, computing the filter's result takes a lot of time, especially when
	tracing causes/consequences without specifying proper range limits in terms of
	event numbers or simulation times. If you cancel a long running operation,
	you can go back to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Filter Dialog</em></span> to modify the filter
	parameters, or simply turn the filter off. To restart drawing, use the refresh button
	<span class="guibutton"><img src="icons/refresh.gif"></span> on the toolbar.
	</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
	  Providing a proper range filter is always a good idea to speed up computing the
	  filter's result.
