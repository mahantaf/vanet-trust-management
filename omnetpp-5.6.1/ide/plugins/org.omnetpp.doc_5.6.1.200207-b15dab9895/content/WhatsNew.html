==========

OMNeT++ 5.6.1 (February 2020)
-----------------------------

This release contains minor stability fixes.


OMNeT++ 5.6 (January 2020)
--------------------------

This is primarily a bugfix release, with a small but practically quite useful
NED feature (@reconnect) and minor additions to the simulation library.
Regarding bugfixes, Qtenv has received quite a lot of attention.

NED:

  - The new @reconnect property allows reconnecting already connected gates
    by specifying it in the new connection's body. This is especially
    useful in INET Framework, e.g. because it eliminates the need for "hook"
    modules in compound modules that represent network interfaces.

Simulation library:

  - SimTime: Added the fromRaw() method.

  - cGate: Added the isGateHalf() and getOtherHalf() methods.

  - The deleteModule() method was moved from cSimpleModule to cModule, revised,
    and its functionality extended: it is now allowed for a running module
    to delete itself, also as part of a module tree. (Note: direct deletion
    of a module or channel object, i.e. via the "delete" operator, is still
    not allowed.)

  - cLabelFigure: Added rotation support (setAngle() method).

  - cAbstractHistogram: Fixed the getCDF() method which was broken.

  - cFigure: Fixed a bug that caused adding figures to be O(n) or slower,
    causing a huge performance penalty with 10000 or more figures.

  - Several further smaller improvements.

Qtenv:

  - Added a "Debug Now" option to the Simulate menu.

  - Allow dragging submodules around by holding Shift. (This works by changing
    the coordinates in the display string.)

  - Added option to export module graphics to an image, and a dialog to
    select the exported area.

  - Start the animation at t=0, not right before the first event.

  - Add some sideways offset to methodcall animation lines and text, to
    reduce overlap with connection arrows.

  - Connection arrows: Make the "m=[nesw]" display string tag work better
    with border-to-border connections.

  - Align the lines of info text ("t" display string tag) of submodules and
    connections appropriately in the left/top/right positions.

  - Performance: cache min(animSpeed) in cCanvas, so that Qtenv doesn't
    have to compute it every time.

  - Set a busy indicator (spinny cursor) during more potentially long
    operations.

  - When the layouting process takes a long time (more than five seconds),
    ask the user what to do (wait or finish).

  - Added an option to disable logging from refreshDisplay().

  - Default log prefix format changed to use %K instead of %C. (%K only prints
    the context component if it is different from the event's module; %C always
    prints it.)

  - Log prefix format: Added the %< (trim preceding whitespace) directive.

  - Keep caret (cursor) near the same event when switching Log Inspector modes.

  - Removed the unused scrollback limit option. Updated the Preferences
    dialog accordingly.

  - Dozens of further bug fixes and improvements.

IDE:

  - Updated to use Eclipse 4.14, CDT 9.10.

  - IDE: Made the "Project Features" menu item more creative in finding
    the project. (It said "Select a project first" much too often.)

  - Analysis Tool: Fix weighted histogram PDF/CDF computation (use sum of
    weights instead of observation count).

  - NED editor: added manual connection routing using the "m" tag.

  - SequenceChart: Avoid out of bounds error when selecting manual axis
    ordering, or switching between "Manual" and "Minimize crossings" modes.

  - EventlogTable, SequenceChart: Strip ANSI escape sequences from log
    message lines.

  - Let the user permanently turn off the "OMNeT++ libraries not yet
    compiled" dialog.

  - Some further fixes and improvements.

Other:

  - scavetool: Fixed vector file indexing bug that caused certain blocks
    to be left out from the index. This also affects the Analysis Tool in
    the IDE, which uses the same code for result file access.

  - opp_test, opp_featuretool: Various small fixes.
