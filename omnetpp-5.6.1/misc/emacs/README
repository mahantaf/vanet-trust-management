NED Syntax Highlight in GNU Emacs
=================================
ned-mode.el

    Author's comment:
    "I have attached a lisp file that implements syntax highlighting
    when editing OMNeT++ .ned file with GNU Emacs. It's not that sophisticated
    but it works OK. Maybe, someone finds this useful (my students like it :-)"


The file ned-mode.el allows syntax highlighting when editing OMNeT++ .ned files
with GNU Emacs. It has been tested with Emacs 20.3.

To make Emacs recognize .ned files put this in your .emacs:

  (autoload 'ned-mode "ned-mode" "Major Mode for editing Ned files" t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ned\\'" . ned-mode) auto-mode-alist))

If you put your ned-mode.el somewhere emacs doesn't find it, add this
to your .emacs before the two statements above:

  (setq load-path (cons "path_to_directory" load-path))

Enjoy.
