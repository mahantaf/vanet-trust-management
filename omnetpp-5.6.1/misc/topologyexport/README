Topology Export
===============

This module allows one to export the topology of a model into an XML file
at runtime.

Usage
-----

The exporter is implemented as a simple module. To activate it, compile its
code into the simulation, then add it to your network NED file as a submodule,
and run the simulation. The exporter module will write a "snapshot" of the
simulation topology at the specified simulation time (default 1s). The file
name and the simulation time to do the export at can be configured as module
parameters.

The output XML document
-----------------------

The structure of the XML document is described in the provided DTD.

The XML document's structure is somewhat similar to the XML representation
of NED files (which can be produced with nedtool's -x option). The differences
are accountable to the fact that NED describes *how* to set up a network,
while the topology XML describes the *result* of the network setup process.
Hence, NED's submodule vectors, gate vectors, 'for' loops etc are present
in the topology XML in "unrolled" form. The topology XML also contains
the values of parameters that came from ini files during network setup,
as well as all modules and connections that have been created dynamically
up to the simulation time the snapshot was taken.
